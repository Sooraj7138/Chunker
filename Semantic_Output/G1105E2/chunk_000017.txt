5.2. GUIDING PRINCIPLES
In order to achieve closer alignment in the portrayal of IALA related navigation information for both shipborne and shore-based users, there are several guiding principles to consider:

5.2. GUIDING PRINCIPLES
The portrayal of information depends on the particular tasks, function, and needs of the various users on ship and ashore.
5.2. GUIDING PRINCIPLES
Critical and non-critical Information should be able to be categorized for the various users as required.
5.2. GUIDING PRINCIPLES
The portrayal of IALA information onboard ships or ashore does not have to be identical.
However, there is benefit to all users if information is displayed in a consistent and unambiguous manner.
This includes the use of standard symbology, icons, and colour schemes as to be defined in IHO GI Registry (S-100 Registry).
5.2. GUIDING PRINCIPLES
Displaying too much supplemental information can obscure critical information or lead to confusion.
As such users should be able to determine the volume or types of non-critical information on the display for their operating tasks and navigational decision making processes.
5.2. GUIDING PRINCIPLES
The portrayal should allow a user to control the system, input data and take action efficiently.
5.2. GUIDING PRINCIPLES
Where possible, the portrayal should indicate invalid and erroneous user input.
5.2. GUIDING PRINCIPLES
The portrayal should be able to display and log significant events.
5.2. GUIDING PRINCIPLES
The portrayal should support the playback of recorded data.
