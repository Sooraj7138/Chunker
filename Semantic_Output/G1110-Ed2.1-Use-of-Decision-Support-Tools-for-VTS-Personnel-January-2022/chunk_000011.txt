EXAMPLES OF WHEN DECISION SUPPORT TOOLS MAY BE USED
The following table provides examples of where DSTs may assist in ensuring the safety and efficiency of navigation, through route and traffic management, monitoring and protection of assets, environmental and fairway monitoring, incident response and anomaly detection.
EXAMPLES OF WHEN DECISION SUPPORT TOOLS MAY BE USED
The table demonstrates the harmonized relationship between the pre-requisites necessary for the alert to work, the type of alert which may be appropriate and the user interface for each use case.
These are further categorized according to whether they are deemed long term planning, near real-time or real-time, which indicates how the system may be used for analysis to identify risks, quantify throughput, and adjust operational procedures as well as real-time incident and situational awareness.
