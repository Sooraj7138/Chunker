PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTING
Where possible, VTS personnel should be engaged to ensure that their experience is taken into account and they have the opportunity to input into the process.
This will also provide the VTS personnel with a sense of “ownership” of the project deliverables.
5.1. PHASE 1: INITIATING
The initiation phase is the beginning of the project.
In this phase, the idea for the project is explored and elaborated.
The goal of this phase is to define the proposed implementation of a VTS at a broad level and its feasibility to address the issues and problems associated with the volume of traffic and degree of risk in the waterway.
This is usually undertaken using:

5.1. PHASE 1: INITIATING
IALA Guideline G1150 Establishing, Planning and Implementing a VTS Edition 3.1 urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1150:ed3.1

5.1. PHASE 1: INITIATING

5.1. PHASE 1: INITIATING
•

5.1. PHASE 1: INITIATING
Business Case - This document identifies the need for a VTS.
In summary, it provides justification for implementing a VTS, including evaluation of the benefits, cost and risk of alternative options and provides a rationale for the preferred solution.
5.1. PHASE 1: INITIATING
•

5.1. PHASE 1: INITIATING
Feasibility study – The purpose of a feasibility study is to establish whether a VTS is a viable solution to address the issue or problem.
The following areas may be considered:

5.1. PHASE 1: INITIATING

• Risk – Identifying and assessing the hazards associated with the volume of traffic and degree of risk in the waterway.
5.1. PHASE 1: INITIATING

• Operational feasibility - Does implementing a VTS meet the needs of the entity by solving problems and/or taking advantage of identified opportunities?
5.1. PHASE 1: INITIATING

• Legality - What are the legal requirements to implement a VTS and can these requirements be met?
5.1. PHASE 1: INITIATING

• Technical capability - Does the entity have the technical capabilities and resources to undertake implementing a VTS?
5.1. PHASE 1: INITIATING

• Budget - Does the entity have the financial resources available, and is the cost/benefit analysis sufficient to justify implementing a VTS?
5.1. PHASE 1: INITIATING
Time - Can a VTS be implemented in a reasonable timeline?
5.1. PHASE 1: INITIATING
To support this phase a process of comprehensive information gathering, and analysis is inevitably involved.
This will enable relevant issues and problems in the maritime area to be identified, assessed, defined, and analyzed.
Possible issues and problems relating to ship traffic include:

5.1. PHASE 1: INITIATING
Interaction of maritime traffic

5.1. PHASE 1: INITIATING
Volume and composition of traffic

5.1. PHASE 1: INITIATING
Protection of the marine environment and the surrounding area

5.1. PHASE 1: INITIATING
The local conditions such as geography, hydrological/meteorological, and tides

5.1. PHASE 1: INITIATING
Whilst there are many different risk management methodologies, IALA offers three risk management tools for assessing the risks in waterways when initiating and planning a VTS.
Annex A contains a list of considerations (many of which are incorporated in the IALA risk management toolbox), to assist in:

5.1. PHASE 1: INITIATING
determining the need for a VTS;

5.1. PHASE 1: INITIATING

• defining the functional requirements needed to achieve the desired level of safety and efficiency and protection of the environment; and

5.1. PHASE 1: INITIATING

• determining the costs associated with implementing a VTS and whether the expected reduction in risk would be justified in terms of the level of investment required.
5.1. PHASE 1: INITIATING
Key components of the IALA risk management toolbox include:

5.1. PHASE 1: INITIATING
•

5.1. PHASE 1: INITIATING
PAWSA – The Ports and Waterways Risk Assessment (PAWSA) tool provides a structured and systematic approach to:

5.1. PHASE 1: INITIATING
identify major waterway safety hazards;

5.1. PHASE 1: INITIATING
estimate risk levels, evaluate potential mitigation measures; and

5.1. PHASE 1: INITIATING
•

5.1. PHASE 1: INITIATING
set the stage for implementation of selected measures to reduce risk.
5.1. PHASE 1: INITIATING
As a qualitative tool, PAWSA is exploratory and the analysis seeks to get a deeper understanding of why a certain phenomenon occurs, its associated consequences and the potential effectiveness of additional mitigation measures.
