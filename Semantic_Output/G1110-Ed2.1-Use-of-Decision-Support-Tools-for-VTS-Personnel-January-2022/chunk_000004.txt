2.1. GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Depending on the needs of the VTS provider, DSTs may require user interaction to fully realize the capabilities of the DST or may be set to run autonomously until the set parameters trigger an alert for the VTSO to attend to.
2.1. GENERAL PRINCIPLES
The operational procedures of the VTS should clarify the use of DST according to the local environment of the VTS area.
2.1. GENERAL PRINCIPLES
The DST can be implemented during or after the establishment of VTS, and if necessary, should be based on the outcome of a formal risk assessment.
2.2. DST USER PERSPECTIVE
DSTs may be implemented in different ways and with differing levels of complexity.
In general, DSTs provide assistance to the VTS operator by integrating a mechanism to alert the operator in real time or near real time to bring awareness and the opportunity to take action where and if required.
2.2. DST USER PERSPECTIVE
In some situations, a DST may provide some suggestions regarding an appropriate course of action.
These suggestions may be based on pre-defined solutions, previously agreed between the VTS provider and the DST provider or may be based on machine learning of previous similar situations.
It will be for the VTS personnel to decide whether, or not, to make use of such suggestions.

2.2. DST USER PERSPECTIVE
The DST may also prompt the VTS operator for additional input in order to help derive a solution to a current situation.
This may be based on pre-defined questions that will help to guide the VTS operator’s thought process or based on machine learning of previous similar situations.
2.2. DST USER PERSPECTIVE
Long term planning of DSTs involves the implementation of defined Operational Procedures within a VTS system in order that the DSTs are correctly configured to address identified risk situations within the VTS area.
