The objectives set should be routinely evaluated to demonstrate they are being achieved”.
IALA Guideline G1131 Setting and Measuring VTS Objectives Edition 1.1 urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1131:ed1.1 P 4 ) IMO MEMBER STATE AUDIT SCHEME (IMSAS) 2.1.3. Under the general provisions of treaty law and of IMO conventions, States are responsible for promulgating laws and regulations and for taking all other steps which may be necessary to give those instruments full and complete effect so as to ensure safety of life at sea and protection of the marine environment.
Key IMO documents regarding IMSAS include those in sections 2.1.4 to 2.1.6. RESOLUTION A.1067(28) ON THE FRAMEWORK AND PROCEDURES FOR THE IMO MEMBER STATE 2.1.4. AUDIT SCHEME The purpose of this framework is to describe the objective, principles, scope, responsibilities and capacity‐building aspect of the IMO Member State audit, which together constitute the strategy for the audit scheme.
This framework is supported by the procedures for the IMO Member State audit and the IMO Instruments Implementation Code (III Code).
RESOLUTION A.1070(28) ON IMO INSTRUMENTS IMPLEMENTATION CODE (III CODE) [4] 2.1.5. The objective of this Code is to enhance global maritime safety and protection of the marine environment and assist States in the implementation of instruments of the Organization.
The Code seeks to address those aspects necessary for a Contracting Government or Party to give full and complete effect to the provisions of the applicable international instruments to which it is a Contracting Government or Party, including SOLAS Chapter V (Safety of Navigation) Regulation

IALA GUIDELINE G1150 ON ESTABLISHING, PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTING A VTS [6] 2.1.7. This Guideline states that: 
• careful planning should be undertaken to ensure a VTS is implemented effectively, achieves its objectives and is sufficiently resourced and funded on an ongoing basis; and 
• when planning and implementing a VTS a project management approach is recommended to ensure the major deliverables, assumptions and constraints are clearly documented.
This will assist in defining the scope of the VTS, its goals and objectives that need to be met.
Project management is considered as a discipline with the purpose to achieve specific goals and objectives by planning, organizing, motivating and controlling resources.
IALA GUIDELINE G1101 ON AUDITING AND ASSESSING A VTS [7] 2.1.8. This Guideline states that to achieve the purposes for which it was implemented, a VTS: “needs to be effective and routinely evaluated to ensure that the operational objectives are being met, the technical and operational performance is acceptable, and the issues identified and defined in determining the need for the VTS have been either alleviated or at least reduced to an acceptable level”.
