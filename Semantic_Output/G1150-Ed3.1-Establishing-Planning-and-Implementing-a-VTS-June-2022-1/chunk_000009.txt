In addition to the VTS specific components listed above, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) [5] lays down a comprehensive regime of law and order in the world’s oceans and seas.
INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION FOR THE SAFETY OF LIFE AT SEA (SOLAS)
SOLAS regulation V/12 recognizes a VTS internationally as a navigational safety measure.
In particular, it provides for VTS and states that:

INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION FOR THE SAFETY OF LIFE AT SEA (SOLAS)
“Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) contribute to safety of life at sea, safety and efficiency of navigation and protection of the marine environment, adjacent shore areas, work sites and offshore installations from possible adverse effects of maritime traffic.”

INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION FOR THE SAFETY OF LIFE AT SEA (SOLAS)
SOLAS also states that:

INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION FOR THE SAFETY OF LIFE AT SEA (SOLAS)
“Governments may establish VTS when, in their opinion, the volume of traffic or the degree of risk justifies such services.”

INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION FOR THE SAFETY OF LIFE AT SEA (SOLAS)
and that:

INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION FOR THE SAFETY OF LIFE AT SEA (SOLAS)
“Governments planning and implementing VTS shall, wherever possible, follow the guidelines developed by the IMO.”
