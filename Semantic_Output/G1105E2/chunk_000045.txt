Data vs.
Information Portrayal

Data
In addition to specific, individual definitions, it is important to make a clear distinction between what is “data” and what is “information”.
In the strictest sense, data can be simply a raw collection of facts, which can exist in any form without meaning, sequence or usability.
Data
In terms of shore-based equipment, systems and services, “data” is usually in alpha-numeric form that is digitally transmitted via electronic means.
Some examples include navigation sensor data (e.g., GPS and radar) or AIS Application Specific Messages.
Data
However, when this data is transformed into a human-readable format (i.e., portrayal) it then becomes “information” capable of being understood by shipborne and shore-based users.
This information can be portrayed in a variety of ways, including alpha-numeric text, point, line or polygon, symbols or icons, and geo-spatial (map or chart).
