1.1. PREAMBLE
A vessel traffic service (VTS) is recognized as a valuable asset to reduce incidents resulting from conflicts in vessel traffic.
This contributes to the safety and efficiency of maritime traffic and protecting the marine environment.
Consequently, a VTS plays an important role in risk management, not only on behalf of maritime traffic safety and fluency, but also on behalf of the continuity of the maritime transport chain.
1.1. PREAMBLE
The role of a VTS is well established and its services are well positioned in the maritime domain.
However, this Guideline has a broad perspective, to help VTS providers in their interaction with other services, outside the VTS area.
1.1. PREAMBLE
Also in the maritime domain, VTS information may be needed to support other services such as maritime security or environmental agencies, with which the VTS provider may not have had previous interaction.
The possible stakeholders who may wish or need to co-operate with the VTS provider need to be identified.
Examples are given in annex A.
1.1. PREAMBLE
Present legislation, guidelines and manuals could be studied in order to identify the limitations on possible interaction with allied and other services, identify inconsistencies with legislation, guidelines and manuals and determine any modifications necessary.
1.1. PREAMBLE
In particular, the references in section 7 may provide guidance in this respect.
