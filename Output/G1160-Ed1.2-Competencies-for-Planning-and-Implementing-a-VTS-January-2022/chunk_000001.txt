A.1158(32) Guidelines for Vessel Traffic Services [4] recommends Contracting Governments and Members of the Organization which are not Contracting Governments to the Convention to take into account the Guidelines contained in the annex when planning and implementing vessel traffic services in accordance with regulation V/12 of the Convention.
IALA Guideline G1150 provides the framework to assist authorities in implementing practices specified in IALA R0119. This includes arranging for establishing, planning and implementing a VTS.

3. OVERVIEW The implementation of a VTS to improve the safety and efficiency of navigation, safety of life at sea and the protection of the marine environment, and its ongoing operation, is a significant investment.
Careful planning should be undertaken to ensure a VTS is implemented effectively, achieves its objectives and is sufficiently resourced and funded on an ongoing basis.
A key factor in achieving this is ensuring that those involved in the planning and implementation are familiar with the international framework for VTS and competency to implement the practices specified in R0119 and associated G1150. The key areas shown in Table 1 include: Table 1 Key areas in establishing, planning and implementing a VTS Activity Key Components How to give effect to SOLAS regulation V/12 (Vessel Traffic Services) of the Convention?
ESTABLISHING International Framework and Obligations National law How to plan for a VTS?
PLANNING Comprehensive information gathering, risk assessment and analysis process to determine the need for a VTS, the feasibility of operating a VTS and the design necessary to achieve the needs identified.

4. ESTABLISHING The international framework for establishing a VTS includes: 
1. International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) 1974; 
2. IMO Resolution A.1158(32) Guidelines for Vessel Traffic Services; 
3. IALA standards; and 
4. National law.

• Promulgating laws and regulations and for taking all other steps which may be necessary to give effect to SOLAS regulation V/12 (Vessel Traffic Services).

• Implementing a regulatory framework for establishing and operating a VTS in accordance with relevant international conventions and IMO instruments, IALA standards and national law.
Appointing and authorizing a competent authority for VTS.

• Authorizing VTS providers to operate VTS and ensuring that VTS training is approved and VTS personnel are certified.

• Ensuring appropriate control and monitoring mechanisms are in place to demonstrate the authority is effectively administering its obligations.
Further guidance on control and monitoring mechanism is provided in IALA Guidelines: 
• G1115 Preparing for an IMO Member State Audit Scheme (IMSAS) on Vessel Traffic Services [5]; and 
• G1101 Auditing and Assessing VTS [6].
4.1. WHAT KNOWLEDGE AND COMPETENCE ARE REQUIRED TO ESTABLISHING VTS?
The following table shows the knowledge and competence within the international framework required to establish VTS: Table 2 Competencies for establishing a VTS Competencies within the international framework for establishing a VTS Topic Element General provisions of treaty law and of IMO Conventions.
In particular, the responsibility of States for promulgating laws and regulations and for taking all other steps which may be necessary to give those instruments full and complete effect so as to ensure safety of life at sea and protection of the marine environment.
This includes:
