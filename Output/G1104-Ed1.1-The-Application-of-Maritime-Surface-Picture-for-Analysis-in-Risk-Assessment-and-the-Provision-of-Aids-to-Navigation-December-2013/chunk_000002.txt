4.3. ASSESSMENT OF MARKING REQUIREMENTS FOR NEW OR EXISTING SHOALS AND SHALLOW AREAS SUBSEQUENT TO HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEY When new survey information is received it is necessary to make an assessment as to whether both charting and AtoN requirements needs to be amended.
This may have relevance to the AtoN already deployed.
A decision shall be made on whether new or amended AtoN are required and the time frame within which they must be deployed.
When new survey information is received the GIS can be used to overlay survey and contour information from both the recent survey and historical data available.
The rate of change and consideration of AtoN in the area can then be clearly examined to make an informed assessment of any changes that may be required.
For example, the number, type, and draught of vessels, will have an impact on the decision for amending the current location of the AtoN or deployment of new AtoN.

DETERMINING AND REVIEWING THE APPROPRIATE OVERALL REQUIREMENTS, NUMBER AND MIX OF AIDS TO NAVIGATION IN EXISTING AND NEW APPLICATIONS By considering the actual coverage of current AtoN provided, including accurate assessment of nominal ranges of both charted and uncharted sectors of fixed lights, together with floating AtoN, then, combining this data with up to date traffic patterns an informed decision on the on-going requirements for existing AtoN and the requirement for additional or different AtoN can be made.

4.5. DETERMINING THE NEED FOR NEW ROUTING MEASURES OR TRAFFIC SEPARATION SCHEMES AIS data and other traffic information can assist in determining whether a new routing measure or separation scheme is required.
The responsible authority, by analysing the AIS data for a specific area of interest, can determine the routes used by different types of vessels.

POST IMPLEMENTATION ANALYSIS Once changes to the shipping routes or the AtoN have been implemented, AIS overlays provide a useful tool to measure the effectiveness of the new measure(s) introduced.

5. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS POSSIBLE LIMITATIONS TO BE CONSIDERED WITH AIS DATA The data and information that is gained through AIS traffic analysis must be treated with a certain amount of caution: The data received from the vessel, other than position information, is dependent on the accuracy of the input from the vessel.
There are many instances where ship dynamic AIS data such as draught and destination are incorrect or suspect.
Many users of AtoN are not required to carry AIS transceivers.
Although many leisure craft now carry AIS class B, this is not mandatory, and as
