There are implications of providing information, warning, advice, or instruction as defined in IMO Resolution A.918(22) Standard Marine Communication Phrases (SMCP) [5].

IMO Resolution A.1158(32) Guidelines for Vessel Traffic Services emphasizes that VTS communications should be timely, clear, concise, and unambiguous.
The effective delivery of a VTS is dependent on the provision of precise and unambiguous voice communications to ships and allied services to minimize the risk of unexpected and dangerous reactions, considerations include:

• While VHF is normally the primary communications medium for a VTS, any available means may be used.

• The use of common communication phrases by VTS personnel reduces the opportunities for misunderstanding and the time required to communicate messages.
IALA has issued detailed guidance on communications in Recommendation R1012 VTS Communications [6] and in Guideline G1132 VTS Voice Communications and Phraseology [7], and the phraseology and content draw on the SMCP Resolution.
Message Markers are essential in VTS Communications and assist where language difficulties exist;

3.2.1. MESSAGE MARKERS
There are eight message markers as defined in SMCP; seven of them are recommended for use by the VTS to emphasize the content of the message or to ensure that the message will be properly understood.
3.2.1. MESSAGE MARKERS
Message markers precede the message or the corresponding part of the message.
Message markers clarify whether the message contains information, warning, advice, instruction, question, answer or request.
Message markers may also be particularly effective when language difficulties are apparent between the VTS and the ship.

3.2.1. MESSAGE MARKERS
It is best practice that a VTS always uses message markers when communicating with ships.
The use of message markers becomes critical when responding to developing unsafe situations.
In such circumstances a degree of stress or urgency frequently exists, and the use of message markers can help to ensure that the purpose of each part of the message is clear and unambiguous.

VTS providers should give particular consideration to the issuing of warnings, advice, or instruction.
