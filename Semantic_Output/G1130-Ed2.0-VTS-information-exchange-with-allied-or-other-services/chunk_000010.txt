3.3.1. MESSAGING PATTERN
Different messaging patterns may be used, depending on the specific data sharing requirements.
In particular, data may be sent from one sender to exactly one receiver or from one sender to many receivers.
The following patterns are most common:

3.3.1. MESSAGING PATTERN

• Publish versus Subscribe; with “publish”, the sender determines what data will be made available and when (independent of any receivers); with “subscribe” the receiver requests what (and, sometimes, when) data will be sent.
3.3.1. MESSAGING PATTERN

• Push versus Pull; with “push” the sender determines what data will be sent and when; with “pull” the receiver requests what data will be sent and when.
3.3.1. MESSAGING PATTERN

• Request/response; with “request” the receiver sends a request for data to the sender; with “response” the sender determines when the requested data will be sent to the receiver.
3.3.1. MESSAGING PATTERN
Continuous data connection (possibly with a “heart beat” to allow redundancy).

• Time stamping.
3.3.1. MESSAGING PATTERN
In principle, data should be appropriately time stamped.
The time stamp should preferably be at the time of origin of the data.
If this is not possible, the data should be time-stamped when received.
3.3.1. MESSAGING PATTERN
Proper time stamping is a pre-requisite, e.g., for proper sequencing of the data and recording and replay.
