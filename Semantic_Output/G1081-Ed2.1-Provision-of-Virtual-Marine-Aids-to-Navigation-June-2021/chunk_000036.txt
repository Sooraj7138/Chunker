11.3. CONTINUITY
Continuity is the probability that, assuming a fault-free system at the receiving end, the Virtual AtoN will be received and displayed on the navigational display over the time interval applicable for a particular operation.
11.3. CONTINUITY
The continuity of a Virtual AtoN service should be determined as described in IALA Recommendation R0121 For the performance and monitoring of a DGNSS Service in the band 283.5 – 325 kHz [20].
The time interval should be chosen as three hours, or a suitable time frame as determined by the competent authority providing the service.
The probability should be according to the category (IALA categories 1, 2 and 3) of each Virtual AtoN.
If a transmitting site is broadcasting signals for multiple Virtual AtoN, the most critical one would determine the continuity requirements for the service.

12. DEVELOPMENT CONSIDERATIONS
For the full benefits of Virtual AtoN to be realised, a number of issues must be addressed in consultation with other bodies, including:


12. DEVELOPMENT CONSIDERATIONS

• Appropriate instruction and training of all mariners and providers as to the provision of Virtual AtoN, symbology, display, and limitations.

12. DEVELOPMENT CONSIDERATIONS

• Harmonization of integration and shipborne navigational system specifications to enable the display of Virtual AtoN for SOLAS ships and other users.

12. DEVELOPMENT CONSIDERATIONS

• Development of a strategy for implementation of Virtual AtoN using non-AIS based systems.

12. DEVELOPMENT CONSIDERATIONS

• The harmonization of the use of MSI by Virtual AtoN within the context of the IMO’s e-Navigation concept.

12. DEVELOPMENT CONSIDERATIONS

• Harmonized presentation of Virtual AtoN.
