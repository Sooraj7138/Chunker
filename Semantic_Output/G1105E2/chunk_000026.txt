IMO Resolution MSC.86(70), Annex 3, Performance Standards for Navigational Equipment, 8 December 1998 IMO Resolution MSC.252(83), Performance Standards for an Integrated Navigation System (INS), 8 October 2007 The purpose of an Integrated Navigation System (INS) is to enhance the safety of navigation by providing integrated and augmented functions to avoid geographic, traffic and environmental hazards.
By combining and integrating functions and information the INS provides “added value” for the operator to plan, monitor and/or control safety of navigation and progress of the ship.
The INS supports the current operational mode and situational awareness.
The INS aims to ensure that by taking human factors into consideration, the workload is not only kept within the capacity of the operator, but system functionality also complements and accounts for mariner capabilities and any existing situational limitations in order to enhance safe and expeditious navigation.
