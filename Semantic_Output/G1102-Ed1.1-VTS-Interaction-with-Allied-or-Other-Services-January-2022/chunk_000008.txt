Nevertheless, the VTS provider may choose to respond to those business needs, as long as the above-mentioned principles or criteria underlying the interaction are respected.

4. INTERACTION WITH ALLIED AND OTHER SERVICES
It should be taken into account, that interaction between a VTS and allied or other services – inside or outside the maritime domain – could be necessary to sustain those services.
In such a case, an arrangement between the VTS provider and the provider(s) of those services should be in place.

4. INTERACTION WITH ALLIED AND OTHER SERVICES
In some cases, when considered necessary, support from a VTS may extend outside the VTS area.
This could result from national, regional or international arrangements.

4. INTERACTION WITH ALLIED AND OTHER SERVICES
Some examples of possible interaction between a VTS and allied or other services are described at annex B.

5. IDENTIFICATION OF POSSIBLE STAKEHOLDERS
The core capability of a VTS is to interact and respond to traffic situations developing in the VTS area.
However, there are other stakeholders who may wish to interact with a VTS or with whom the VTS wishes to interact.

5. IDENTIFICATION OF POSSIBLE STAKEHOLDERS
In this case, an arrangement should be set up between the VTS provider and the stakeholder(s), and it may be expected that issues and consideration to specific details should be given, as in chapter 3, in order to avoid unintended action, which may impair the VTS services.
This may vary, depending on the country and legislation applicable.

5. IDENTIFICATION OF POSSIBLE STAKEHOLDERS
In addition to the given possible stakeholders as at annex A, the VTS provider may become involved, if not already, in the exchange of traffic related information with state, provincial or local government, and associated agencies or organizations, for purposes less familiar to the maritime domain; such as monitoring emissions from shipping, securing vital supply chains for society and assessing the risks associated with maritime transport of dangerous or polluting cargo close to coastal or port communities.

5. IDENTIFICATION OF POSSIBLE STAKEHOLDERS
Examples of possible stakeholders are described in annex A.

6. LEGAL ASPECTS AND CONSTRAINTS
IALA Guideline G1086 Global Sharing of Maritime Data and Information [1] already provides valuable guidance on legal aspects.

6. LEGAL ASPECTS AND CONSTRAINTS
Actually, there is a range of potential legal aspects and constraints that could affect the merit of and ability to use VTS information for allied and other services.
The nature of these will vary between different countries and has to be taken into consideration.

Further considerations in this respect are provided at annex D.
