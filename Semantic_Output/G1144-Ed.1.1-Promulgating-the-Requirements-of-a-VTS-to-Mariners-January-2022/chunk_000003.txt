1. INTRODUCTION
IMO Resolution A.1158(32) Guidelines for Vessel Traffic Services [1] states that the VTS provider should “ensure that information regarding requirements and procedures of VTS and the categories of ships required to participate in VTS are promulgated in appropriate nautical publications”.
This includes such items as:


1. INTRODUCTION
the categories of vessels required or expected to participate;


1. INTRODUCTION
communication means to be used for reporting and the interaction between ship and shore;


1. INTRODUCTION

• areas of applicability;


1. INTRODUCTION
the times and geographical positions for submitting reports;


1. INTRODUCTION
the format and content of the required reports;


1. INTRODUCTION

• the VTS provider responsible for the operation of the service; and


1. INTRODUCTION
services to be provided to participating ships.

1. INTRODUCTION
This information is currently provided through various sources (e.g., port user guides, Admiralty List of Radio Signals, etc.) and in a manner that has no standardized structure or format.

1. INTRODUCTION
It should however be recognized that the organization of the service provision may differ on national, regional or local level due to e.g., traffic density and geographical circumstances.

1. INTRODUCTION
The use of differing vessel traffic service procedures may cause confusion to masters of vessels moving from one vessel traffic service area to another.
