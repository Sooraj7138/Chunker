2.2. SECURITY REQUIREMENTS
The security requirements needed to derive the functional and performance requirements should include, but not

2.2. SECURITY REQUIREMENTS
be limited to:

2.2. SECURITY REQUIREMENTS

• Physical security of the VTS Centre and remote sites

2.2. SECURITY REQUIREMENTS

• Cyber security

2.2. SECURITY REQUIREMENTS
Business continuity, availability, reliability and disaster recovery

2.3. OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS
The operational requirements needed to derive the functional and performance requirements should include, but

2.3. OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS
not be limited to:

2.3. OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS

• Delineating the VTS area and, if appropriate, VTS sub-areas or sectors

2.3. OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS
Types and sizes of ships required or expected to participate in the VTS

2.3. OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS

• Navigational hazards and traffic patterns

2.3. OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS

• Human/machine interface and human factors, including health and safety issues

2.3. OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS
Tasks to be performed by VTS operators and/or supervisors

2.3. OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS

• Operational procedures, including communication, staffing level and operating hours of the VTS

2.3. OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS
Information sharing and co-operation with external stakeholders

2.3. OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS

• Legal framework

2.4. DERIVING FUNCTIONAL AND PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS
The functional and performance requirements for a VTS system should be derived from the operational requirements.
This may be an iterative process, which can be aligned with the phases of Guideline G1150.

2.4. DERIVING FUNCTIONAL AND PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS
In order to define functional and performance requirements, the operational requirements may be grouped into:

2.4. DERIVING FUNCTIONAL AND PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS

• communications

2.4. DERIVING FUNCTIONAL AND PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS

• situational awareness

2.4. DERIVING FUNCTIONAL AND PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS

• recording and playback

2.4. DERIVING FUNCTIONAL AND PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS

• reliability and availability

2.4. DERIVING FUNCTIONAL AND PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS
The grouping of operational requirements facilitates the creation of functional and performance requirements, for example, divided into:

2.4. DERIVING FUNCTIONAL AND PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS

• voice and data communication

2.4. DERIVING FUNCTIONAL AND PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS
the VTS Centre, sites, sensors and processing

2.4. DERIVING FUNCTIONAL AND PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS
recording and replay, including post situational analysis

2.4. DERIVING FUNCTIONAL AND PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS

• redundancy and resilience

2.4. DERIVING FUNCTIONAL AND PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS
Deriving system concepts may involve various mathematical, functional and simulation models to visualize different characteristics of the system.
Models to consider might include, but not be limited to:

2.4. DERIVING FUNCTIONAL AND PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS

• Radio communications coverage

2.4. DERIVING FUNCTIONAL AND PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS

• Sensor coverage

2.4. DERIVING FUNCTIONAL AND PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS

• Communications network infrastructure

2.4. DERIVING FUNCTIONAL AND PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS

• Data architecture and interfaces

2.4. DERIVING FUNCTIONAL AND PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS
Reliability and availability, including any redundancy options

2.4. DERIVING FUNCTIONAL AND PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS

• Lifecycle costs

2.4. DERIVING FUNCTIONAL AND PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS
The models could assist in establishing the relationship between the system concepts, associated functional and performance requirements and operational requirements.
Feasibility studies (site surveys, equipment trials etc.) may also be appropriate to reduce technical risks which may otherwise not be apparent until implementation.
2.4. DERIVING FUNCTIONAL AND PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS
Additional functional and performance requirements may come from, but not be limited to:

2.4. DERIVING FUNCTIONAL AND PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS
Environmental considerations

2.4. DERIVING FUNCTIONAL AND PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS

• Legal obligations

2.4. DERIVING FUNCTIONAL AND PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS

• Ergonomic issues

2.4. DERIVING FUNCTIONAL AND PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS
Safety (other than navigational safety)

2.4. DERIVING FUNCTIONAL AND PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS

• Security requirements, e.g., physical security, personnel security, cyber security incl.
software updates during operation

2.4. DERIVING FUNCTIONAL AND PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS

• Operational business rules or operational procedures
