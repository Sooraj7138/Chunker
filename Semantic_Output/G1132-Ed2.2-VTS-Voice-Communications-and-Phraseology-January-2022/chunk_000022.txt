5.1.7. COURSE
As a general term, “Course” refers to the intended direction of movement of a ship through the water.
Unless it is intended to use this term in a general sense, one of the specific descriptors below should normally be used by VTS and expressed in 360-degree notation from True North unless otherwise stated.
A mariner will not normally use a decimal course (i.e., course 162.3 degrees identified on the VTS Decision Support Tool (DST) would be referred to 162 degrees when stated over the radio).
