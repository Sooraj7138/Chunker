10.2.4. DISPLAY LIMITATIONS
Although there are clear benefits that can be gained by providing safety information through Virtual AtoN, it must be borne in mind that not all SOLAS class ships, or other craft, may have the ability to display the Virtual AtoN.
Some smaller craft may never have the ability to display Virtual AtoN.
10.2.4. DISPLAY LIMITATIONS
MKD – All SOLAS class vessels are required to be fitted with a Class A AIS station and many non-SOLAS vessels voluntarily carry Class A AIS or Class B AIS stations.
However, a growing number of vessels integrate the AIS data into a navigational display such as ECDIS or radar.
The display of Virtual AtoN on an AIS MKD is limited to alpha- numeric text and, on some units, a graphic display, although there is no standard for such display.
10.2.4. DISPLAY LIMITATIONS
Radar – Only radars that meet the revised performance standard, which came into force in 2008, have a requirement to be capable of displaying a Virtual AIS AtoN.
However, there is currently no IMO requirement for the AIS to be integrated or displayed on radar.
10.2.4. DISPLAY LIMITATIONS
ECDIS – ECDIS mandatory carriage requirement for certain classes of SOLAS vessel has been implemented in stages up to 2018, however, the current ECDIS performance standard MSC 232(82) [2] does not require AIS or other Virtual AtoN to be displayed, nor to be integrated.
10.2.4. DISPLAY LIMITATIONS
Permanent deployment of Virtual AtoN will be represented on ENC/ECS with a charted AIS AtoN symbol.
There will be overlapping since the charting symbol will be present at the same time as the broadcast AIS, with the exception of the issuance or cancellation time of the charted symbol.
Some static information will be duplicated on both symbols.
Some text information may also be present at the Virtual AtoN’s displayed location in connection with a NAVTEX or SafetyNET for MSI.

10.2.4. DISPLAY LIMITATIONS
Competent authorities should take into account the limited display capabilities for AIS, or other forms of transmission, for all classes of seaborne craft when assessing the value and risks associated with transmitting Virtual AtoN.
10.2.5. USE OF VIRTUAL ATON IN CONFINED WATERWAYS
Navigation in narrow channels where there is less room to manoeuvre a vessel, such as in pilotage waters, requires the most accurate navigational marks possible for safety of navigation.
Mariners have started incorporating the use of Virtual AtoN on radar, when such AIS interface is available, as a means of supplementing their existing navigational means.
10.2.5. USE OF VIRTUAL ATON IN CONFINED WATERWAYS
Mariners see the value in the way Virtual AIS AtoN highlight and allow for the rapid positive identification of some natural or artificial navigational features.
This is especially beneficial during weather, ice, and situations with traffic radar cluttering.
Racons continue to be an essential element and should be the primary choice as they are isolated from any GNSS induced errors.

In Figure 10, three Virtual AIS AtoN are deployed to mark artificial islands used as target marks for winter navigation.
The top sketch shows them displayed on an ECS, and the bottom sketch shows them on radar screen.
The radar target appears right in the centre of the Virtual symbol, facilitating the positive identification through ice clutter for mariners.
10.2.5. USE OF VIRTUAL ATON IN CONFINED WATERWAYS
There have been reports of Virtual AIS AtoN symbols appearing offset from where they were expected to appear on the radar.
This is happening even when a precise and unaltered position is broadcast.
This is usually represented by a mismatch between a definite radar echo, such as a fixed pillar, and the cross lines centred on the Virtual AIS AtoN symbol.

10.2.5. USE OF VIRTUAL ATON IN CONFINED WATERWAYS
An important factor to consider with AIS interfaced on radar, is the AIS positional process.
The Virtual AIS AtoN position displayed on the radar PPI is based on the calculation that is made between the just-received Virtual AIS AtoN broadcast position and the ship’s actual GNSS position through the process of Latitude/Longitude being converted to bearing/distance.
Any error with the GNSS position, for example, an error caused by time lag, will directly impact where the Virtual AIS AtoN symbol will appear on the radar.
This may mislead mariners into thinking that the Virtual AIS AtoN broadcast position is faulty, which is most likely not the case.

10.2.5. USE OF VIRTUAL ATON IN CONFINED WATERWAYS
In Figure 12, a matching ship’s GNSS and radar antenna on a moving ship should translate into a Virtual AIS AtoN symbol at a close location to the radar echo target of the broadcasted feature.
A delayed GNSS antenna position on the ship, shown as a ghost image, would translate into an offset Virtual AIS AtoN symbol displayed in comparison to the radar echo target.
10.2.5. USE OF VIRTUAL ATON IN CONFINED WATERWAYS
Once the AIS AtoN provider has validated that the Virtual AIS AtoN broadcast is adequate and contains no errors, some assumptions can be made regarding the possible causes of shipborne-related errors.
The ITU standard allows

This is an important process in order to help the user build confidence in the service.
10.2.5. USE OF VIRTUAL ATON IN CONFINED WATERWAYS
The potential sources of errors can be classified into three categories:

10.2.5. USE OF VIRTUAL ATON IN CONFINED WATERWAYS
1 Limitations of the GNSS interfacing with the radar system:

10.2.5. USE OF VIRTUAL ATON IN CONFINED WATERWAYS
Time delayed error (smoothing update too long, processing, etc.).
10.2.5. USE OF VIRTUAL ATON IN CONFINED WATERWAYS

• Quality of the equipment and/or wrong settings (geographic datum, lack of upgrade in the firmware, non-supported model, etc.).
10.2.5. USE OF VIRTUAL ATON IN CONFINED WATERWAYS

10.2.5. USE OF VIRTUAL ATON IN CONFINED WATERWAYS
Equipment truncating or rounding the precise coordinate being broadcasted.
10.2.5. USE OF VIRTUAL ATON IN CONFINED WATERWAYS

• Small scale in use causes distance and bearing errors that degrade the accuracy of the comparative radar target.
10.2.5. USE OF VIRTUAL ATON IN CONFINED WATERWAYS

• Gyrocompass errors leading to bearing errors for the comparative radar target.
10.2.5. USE OF VIRTUAL ATON IN CONFINED WATERWAYS

• Physical position of the vessel in relation to the radar target.
10.2.5. USE OF VIRTUAL ATON IN CONFINED WATERWAYS
3 Antenna offset:

10.2.5. USE OF VIRTUAL ATON IN CONFINED WATERWAYS

• GNSS antenna and/or radar antenna location on the ship are not related precisely to the Consistent Common Reference Point (CCRP) of the ship, usually the conning position.
10.2.5. USE OF VIRTUAL ATON IN CONFINED WATERWAYS
Competent authorities are encouraged to warn their users about these potential position offset situations.
Some of the solutions and guidance proposed to manage these issues are listed below:

10.2.5. USE OF VIRTUAL ATON IN CONFINED WATERWAYS

• Users may validate if the displayed Virtual AIS AtoN position in the information box of the radar is identical to the advertised one from MSI or official publications.
Validating the location and the associated information of the AIS AtoN symbol on other display systems such as ECDIS, ECS, PPU, etc., can also provide meaningful information.
10.2.5. USE OF VIRTUAL ATON IN CONFINED WATERWAYS

• Mariners may use the Target Tracking (TT) tool of the radar and place it directly on the AIS AtoN to validate that the TT coordinates displayed match those advertised for the Virtual AIS AtoN.
The use of largest possible radar scale is recommended in order to get the best TT accuracy.
10.2.5. USE OF VIRTUAL ATON IN CONFINED WATERWAYS

• Some competent authorities have started providing Predicted Synthetic and/or Virtual AIS AtoN schematic reference point patterns associated with well-defined navigational marks to assist mariners in assessing the magnitude of the position offset.
Some radar tools, such as the EBL and VRM, can be used to validate that the displayed information is identical to that provided on the schematic reference point diagram.

10.2.6. USE OF VIRTUAL AIS FOR MARKING RESTRICTED AREAS

10.2.5. USE OF VIRTUAL ATON IN CONFINED WATERWAYS
In addition to regular maritime safety enhancement measures, it may be advisable to use Virtual AtoN (Type Special Mark) to identify temporary restriction areas, to prevent intrusion.
10.2.5. USE OF VIRTUAL ATON IN CONFINED WATERWAYS
If the area is marked with several Virtual AtoN, the name for each object should be the name together with the serial number or the weather dash.

10.2.5. USE OF VIRTUAL ATON IN CONFINED WATERWAYS
This type of Virtual AtoN should not be established onshore to avoid misleading mariners.
Similarly, establishment in Traffic Separation Schemes (TSS) or Deep Water Routes should be avoided if there are no specific reasons.
11.1. AVAILABILITY
The basic principles for categorizing AtoN in accordance with their importance is described Recommendation R0130 Categorisation and Availability Objectives for Short Range Aids to Navigation (O-130 ) [23].
Virtual AtoN Services should be categorized in the same manner.
in IALA

11.1. AVAILABILITY
If a transmitting site is broadcasting signals for multiple Virtual AtoN, the most critical AtoN would determine the availability requirements for the service.
It should be noted that Virtual AtoN transmitting sites must deliver a specified minimum signal strength at the user antenna within a specified service area.
11.1. AVAILABILITY
IALA Recommendation R0126 Use of the Automatic Identification System (A-126) [22] defines the required availability for Virtual AIS AtoN and sets the service area criteria in terms of required signal strength.
11.1. AVAILABILITY
Similar signal strength criteria should be defined for transmissions broadcast via means other than AIS.
11.1. AVAILABILITY
Availability is determined by the ability to deliver the specified reporting rate, signal strength and valid information content.
Virtual AtoN criteria should be specified for each of these elements in order to clearly define when the service is no longer available (failure state).
11.2. INTEGRITY ALERTING
Authorised service providers should have the ability to provide users with warnings within a specified time period when a Virtual AtoN service is not available.

11.2. INTEGRITY ALERTING
P 21

11.2. INTEGRITY ALERTING
The warning should be given within a time frame compatible with the criticality of the AtoN (IALA Categories 1, 2

11.2. INTEGRITY ALERTING
and 3).
11.2. INTEGRITY ALERTING
Warnings may be issued as MSI and, in the case of AIS using the flags of Message 21, using Message 14 or by any other appropriate means.
11.2. INTEGRITY ALERTING
There is a requirement for integrity monitoring.
Such monitoring schemes should be independent of the system providing the basic service.
Integrity monitoring can take place both onboard a vessel and ashore.
11.2. INTEGRITY ALERTING
Shipborne monitoring is limited to validity checking of the received data and the reporting rate of the Virtual AtoN.
