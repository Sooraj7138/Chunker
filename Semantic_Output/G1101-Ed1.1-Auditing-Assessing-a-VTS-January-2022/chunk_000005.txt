4. RESPONSIBILITIES
The responsibilities of the Contracting Governments/competent authorities and VTS providers in planning, establishing and operating a VTS are described in IMO Resolution A.1158(32) Guidelines for Vessel Traffic Services.
Recognizing that the relationship between the competent authority and the VTS provider may differ between countries the following guidance is provided for the respective responsibilities.
4.1. CONTRACTING GOVERNMENT / COMPETENT AUTHORITY
The Contracting Government should:

establish a legal basis for VTS that gives effect to regulation V/12 of the Convention; and

4.1. CONTRACTING GOVERNMENT / COMPETENT AUTHORITY
appoint and authorize a competent authority for VTS.
4.1. CONTRACTING GOVERNMENT / COMPETENT AUTHORITY
The competent authority for VTS should:

4.1. CONTRACTING GOVERNMENT / COMPETENT AUTHORITY

• establish a regulatory framework for establishing and operating VTS in accordance with relevant international conventions and IMO instruments, IALA standards and national law; and

4.1. CONTRACTING GOVERNMENT / COMPETENT AUTHORITY

4.1. CONTRACTING GOVERNMENT / COMPETENT AUTHORITY
The Contracting Government/competent authority should ensure the on-going effectiveness of the VTS and consistency with international guidelines through audits and/or periodic assessments.
Such assessments could be managed by the Contracting Government/competent authority itself or by an accredited third party, such as an IALA approved classification society (IALAACS).
However, even though the audits or assessments are made by a third party, the responsibility always lies with the Contracting Government/competent authority.
