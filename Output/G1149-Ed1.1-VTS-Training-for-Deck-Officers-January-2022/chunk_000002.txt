VTS Training for Deck Officers Edition 1.1 urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1149:ed1.1 P 6 3.4.3. FUNCTIONS VTS functions can be subdivided into internal and external functions.
Internal functions are the preparatory activities that have to be performed to enable a VTS to operate.
These include data collection, data evaluation and decision-making.
External functions are activities executed with the purpose of influencing traffic.
They relate to the primary traffic management functions of rule-making, allocation of space, control of ships and ship manoeuvres to avoid collisions, as well as to other management functions such as enforcement, remedial and ancillary activities.
Amongst the most important functions that a VTS may carry out are those related to, contributing to and thereby enhancing and supporting: 
• Safety of life at sea 
• Safety of navigation 
• Eficiency of vessel traffic movement 
• Protection of the marine environment 
• Maritime security 
• Search and rescue 
• Law enforcement 
• Protection of adjacent communities and infrastructure BENEFITS OF VTS FOR THE BRIDGE TEAM 3.5. A VTS has real-time knowledge and provides the following benefits for the bridge team: 
• Information about coastal, port and inland waterways and infrastructures and its key and vulnerable locations, thereby improving maritime traffic efficiency.

• Information about ship activities, including ship position and intention, etc., thereby improving the situational awareness between ships.

• Navigational assistance in difficult navigation conditions to ensure the safety of ships.

• Knowledge of conventional port operations, including ship voyage and passage planning and port interface activities, thereby reducing the pressure in voyage and passage planning and help deck officers fully understand the navigation environment in complex traffic situations.
Information concerning the coordination of medical assistance in emergency situations.
3.6. VTS AND SHIP REPORTING SYSTEMS Ship Reporting Systems (SRS) and reporting requirements are used to provide, gather or exchange information through radio reports or other electronic means.
The information is used to provide data for many purposes including search and rescue, vessel traffic services, weather forecasting and prevention of marine pollution.
Ship routeing measures and SRS are passive where ships provide information through predetermined reporting requirements.
VTS is proactive, continuously monitoring ship traffic and providing relevant information.
The deck officer should be aware that: IALA Guideline G1149 VTS Training for Deck Officers Edition 1.1 urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1149:ed1.1 P 7 
• VTS, Traffic Separation Schemes (TSS) and SRS can be used independently or in combination.

• SRS often provides data for VTS traffic images.

• Both VTS and SRS may be mandatory or voluntary.
3.7. PROVISION OF VTS 3.7.1. PROVISION OF TIMELY AND RELEVANT INFORMATION The provision of timely and relevant information on factors influencing the ship's movements and assist on-board decision making may include: 
• Position, identity, intention and movements of ships 
• Maritime Safety Information 
• Limitations of ships in the VTS area that may impose restrictions on the navigation of other ships (e.g., manoeuvrability), or any other potential hindrances.

• Other information such as reporting formalities and International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) code details.

• Support to, and cooperation with, allied services.
This information may be provided: 
• At fixed times (i.e.
broadcast) or time-intervals.

• On demand (when requested by ships) 
• When deemed necessary by the VTS 3.7.2. MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT OF TRAFFIC The monitoring and management of traffic to ensure the safety and efficiency of ship movements may include: 
• Forward planning of ship movements 
• Organizing ships underway 
• Organizing space allocation 
• Establishing a system of traffic clearances 
• Establishing a system of voyage or passage plans 
• Providing route advice 
• Ensuring compliance with and enforcement of regulatory provisions for which they are empowered 3.7.3. RESPONDING TO DEVELOPING UNSAFE SITUATIONS Developing unsafe situations may include: 
• A ship unsure of its route or position.

• A ship deviating from the route.

• A ship requiring guidance to an anchoring position.

• A ship that has defects or deficiencies, such as navigation or manoeuvring equipment failure.

• Severe meteorological conditions (e.g., low visibility, strong winds).

• A ship at risk of grounding or collision.
IALA Guideline G1149 VTS Training for Deck Officers Edition 1.1 urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1149:ed1.1 P 8 A VTS may also assist in emergency response or support to emergency services.
3.8. VTS PROCEDURES A VTS operates in accordance with the requirements set by the competent authority.
VTS procedures are integral to the safety management system ensuring the services are delivered accurately, efficiently and effectively.
This includes both internal and external procedures.
More information can be found in IALA Guideline G1141 Operational Procedures for Vessel Traffic Services.

4. ALLIED AND OTHER SERVICES A VTS actively interacts with allied and other services which are also involved in the safe and efficient passage of the ship through a VTS area.
Allied services include pilotage, tugs, line handlers, port authorities, search and rescue and customs authorities.
