• material damage to marine infrastructure external to a ship, that could seriously endanger the safety of the ship, another ship or an individual; or severe damage to the environment, or the potential for severe damage to the environment, brought about by the damage of a ship or ships.

• A marine incident is defined in MSC.255 (84), known as the Casualty Investigation Code, as an event, or sequence of events, other than a marine casualty, which has occurred directly in connection with the operations of a ship that endangered, or, if not corrected, would endanger the safety of the ship, its occupants or any other person or the environment.

• A near-miss is defined in MSC-MEPC.7/Circ.7 Guidance on near-miss reporting, as a sequence of events and/or conditions that could have resulted in loss.
This loss was prevented only by a fortuitous break in the chain of events and/or conditions.
The potential loss could be human injury, environmental damage, or negative business impact (e.g., repair or replacement costs, scheduling delays, contract violations, loss of reputation).
CASUALTY A 7 @ (major damages & casualties) Risk (no or few damages) (no damage) Normal Abnormal situation situation Figure 1 Classification of Near-Miss, Incident and Casualty situations Initiatives such as the Line Operation Safety Audit (LOSA) clearly demonstrate that errors also occur in normal operations, therefore the identification of “normal situations” (or normal operations) does not preclude the possibility of incidents or near misses.
It may be possible that a near-miss is not detected either on board a ship or by VTS personnel, then the situation still appears as a “normal situation” (N).
Figure 1 should be read based on a risk scale from no damage to few damages and casualties.
Where the main difference between near-miss and incident can be described as follows, near-miss is only a fortuitous break in the chain of events prevented occurrence of a casualty and the incident is a situation that has involved no or few damages, however, if there are any damages they are minor, and casualties are prevented.
The real situation assessment (R) should be compared under some defined criteria by VTS personnel in order to identify whether a casualty, an incident or a near-miss occurred.
See annex A for the models and flowcharts for monitoring, recording and understanding developing situations.
UNDERSTANDING SITUATION AND ASSOCIATED DATA The correct assessment of the situation by the VTS personnel is fundamental for the actions to be taken for preventing casualties or reducing navigational and environmental risks.
IALA Guideline G1118 Marine Casualty / Incident Reporting and Recording, Including Near-miss Situations as it Relates to a VTS Edition 1.1 urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1017:ed1.1 P 5 3.1. DECISIONS, CRITERIA AND INVESTIGATION TOOLS A VTS provider should establish criteria that determine operational effectiveness, such as safety margins, monitor the VTS area with respect to these criteria, and use those criteria when investigating incidents.
These criteria might also be used for decision support tools within VTS.
From a viewpoint of VTS personnel, managing and, where possible, reducing risks, depend to a great extent on the capability of the VTS sensors and the prevailing circumstances and conditions of the VTS area.
The procedures to identify situations where risk may be increasing, or where measures of operational effectiveness e.g., safety margins, have possibly been exceeded, should be integrated as routine procedures in the VTS Centre according to IALA Guideline G1141 [4].
Decision and criteria of the risks should be based on the evaluation of various risks including: Determining factors, for example: 
• CPA/TCPA factor 
• Emergency manoeuvre of a vessel Complaint addressed to the VTS centre Absence of lookout and watch-keeping Contributing factors, for example: 
• Weather and visibility conditions 
• Density of traffic 
• Dangerousness of the cargo on board 
• Proximity of shallow waters 
• Manoeuvrability of the vessel When casualty/incident/near-miss do occur, it is appropriate to use a coding scheme or a framework to both guide the investigation and to categorize the contributing factors.
The results of these investigations should be placed in a form that allows a VTS provider to detect patterns over time.
Frameworks that might be appropriate for this include the: 
• Human Factors Accident Classification System (HFACS) 
• Root Cause Analysis 
• “Five Whys” or any approach that is comprehensive, assesses contributing factors at multiple levels of organization (i.e., individual, team, organization, system), which attempt to understand how the responses to the situation were considered logical and reasonable under the circumstances, and consider the event in the context of the complex maritime system.
