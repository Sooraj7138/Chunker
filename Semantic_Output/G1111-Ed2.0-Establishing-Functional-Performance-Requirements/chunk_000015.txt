LIGHTNING PROTECTION 3.3.3.
Lightning protection is often subject to national or local legislation taking into account local conditions, severity, earth conductivity, power grid constraints etc.
The guidance from country to country differs depending on lightning strike frequency and severity.
As a consequence, requirements for the number and type of lightning arrestors, the number of earthing points and the minimum cross sectional area of conductors vary to suit local conditions.
LIGHTNING PROTECTION 3.3.3.
The general principles include:

LIGHTNING PROTECTION 3.3.3.

• Lightning arrestors and/or conductors should be positioned higher than other equipment and be designed to protect the entire installation.
LIGHTNING PROTECTION 3.3.3.
Separate down conductor(s) on the exterior of buildings should not be connected to metal parts of buildings such as steel reinforcements, handrails and antenna masts.
LIGHTNING PROTECTION 3.3.3.
•

LIGHTNING PROTECTION 3.3.3.
Safety grounding of equipment should be kept separate from lightning protection.
LIGHTNING PROTECTION 3.3.3.
•

LIGHTNING PROTECTION 3.3.3.
Potential equalization should be achieved in earth and never at the top of the equipment.
See Guideline G1012 The Protection of Lighthouses and Other Aids to Navigation against Damage from Lightning for further information.

• Warning lights.
LIGHTNING PROTECTION 3.3.3.
High structures, such as RADAR towers, may require warning lights for air traffic.
Some light arrangements may also be disturbing to both vessel traffic, the general public and to birds and animals.
It is therefore recommended to consult local authorities for specific requirements or restrictions in the area.
LIGHTNING PROTECTION 3.3.3.
SITE AND EQUIPMENT ACCESS 3.3.4.

LIGHTNING PROTECTION 3.3.3.
As part of the selection of a VTS system location, the VTS provider should analyse the need for site access for installation and maintenance.
Fencing and other protective means against illegal intrusion may also be needed in many cases.
ELECTRICAL POWER 3.3.5.
The VTS system could require a reliable source of electrical power, which could include a backup power source such as an Uninterruptable Power Supply (UPS) and/or generator.
ELECTRICAL POWER 3.3.5.
Renewable sources should be used where appropriate.
ELECTRICAL POWER 3.3.5.
SAFETY AND SECURITY PRECAUTIONS 3.3.6.

ELECTRICAL POWER 3.3.5.
For each location, the VTS provider should implement safety and security requirements in accordance with relevant legislation.
ELECTRICAL POWER 3.3.5.
Safety requirements should, at least, consider but are not limited to:

ELECTRICAL POWER 3.3.5.
safety procedures, such as instructions to personnel performing maintenance;

ELECTRICAL POWER 3.3.5.
personnel protection equipment for working at heights;

ELECTRICAL POWER 3.3.5.
•

lone working on remote sites;

ELECTRICAL POWER 3.3.5.
safety switches to isolate equipment and to stop rotating antennas;

ELECTRICAL POWER 3.3.5.
•

ELECTRICAL POWER 3.3.5.
precautions regarding electromagnetic radiation, rotating machinery and electrical shock, railings on masts etc.; and

ELECTRICAL POWER 3.3.5.

• protection of the general public.
ELECTRICAL POWER 3.3.5.
Security requirements should, at least, consider:

ELECTRICAL POWER 3.3.5.
physical restrictions, e.g., fences, locks, motion sensors, monitoring (CCTV); and

ELECTRICAL POWER 3.3.5.
access procedures, i.e., restrictions imposed by ISPS.
ELECTRICAL POWER 3.3.5.
EQUIPMENT PRESERVATION AND MONITORING 3.3.7.

ELECTRICAL POWER 3.3.5.
The VTS provider should also consider the following:

ELECTRICAL POWER 3.3.5.
fire detection and (remote) alarms;

ELECTRICAL POWER 3.3.5.

• automated fire extinguishers;

• remote monitoring of equipment status.
ELECTRICAL POWER 3.3.5.
MARKING AND IDENTIFICATION 3.3.8.

ELECTRICAL POWER 3.3.5.
VTS equipment should be marked with manufacturer name, type and serial number.
ELECTRICAL POWER 3.3.5.
Legislation may require additional marking or identification, signposts etc.
