and environmental hazards.
By combining and integrating functions and information the INS provides “added value” for the operator to plan, monitor and/or control safety of navigation and progress of the ship.
The INS supports the current operational mode and situational awareness.
The INS aims to ensure that by taking human factors into consideration, the workload is not only kept within the capacity of the operator, but system functionality also complements and accounts for mariner capabilities and any existing situational limitations in order to enhance safe and expeditious navigation.
INS functions that have particular relevance to IALA include: Route monitoring Collision avoidance Alert management Special manoeuvres Functional requirements for INS displays include: IALA Guideline G1105 Shore-side Portrayal Ensuring Harmonization with e-Navigation Related Information Edition 2.0 urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1105:ed2.0 7) P 12 All essential information should be displayed clearly and continuously Additional navigational information may be displayed, but should not mask, obscure or degrade essential information required for the display by its primary task, as specified in these performance standards The INS should be capable of displaying data available from the sensors The information should be displayed together with the indication of its source (sensor data, result of calculation or manual input), unit of measurement and status, including mode Display and update of essential information available in the equipment as well as safety-related automatic functions should not be inhibited due to operation of the equipment Default display configurations and operational modes including user-defined display modes (i.e., pre- defined or user defined) Mode and status awareness Information display Guidance is also given related to Human Machine Interface (HMI): The portrayal should present information to the user intuitively; The portrayal should facilitate achieving an appropriate situational awareness and support effective decision-making; The portrayal should be designed for efficiency of operation and avoidance of information overload; Physical conditions and ergonomics are very important as are workload, shift arrangements and reserve capacity; and Human-centred design (HCD) and an ergonomic approach should be followed.
MSC.1/Circ.1512 defines HCD as “an approach to system design and development that aims to make interactive systems more usable by focussing on the use of the system; applying human factors, ergonomics and usability knowledge and techniques.” More detailed information can be found in MSC.1/Circ.1512.

IEC 61924-2 Maritime navigation and radiocommunication equipment and systems - Integrated navigation systems (INS) - Part 2: Modular structure for INS - Operational and performance requirements, methods of testing and required test results,2021 Edition 2.0. This standard specifies the minimum requirements for the design, manufacture, integration, methods of testing and required test results for an integrated navigation system (INS) to comply with the IMO requirements of Resolution MSC 252(83).
Specific guidance related to presentation and display considerations is provided in: IALA Guideline G1105 Shore-side Portrayal Ensuring Harmonization with e-Navigation Related Information Edition 2.0 urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1105:ed2.0 P 13 Section 6.4 - Functional requirements for displays of INS Section 6.5 - Human Machine Interface (HMI) Section 7 (Module C) - Alert Management Annex D – Display Default Configurations EXAMPLES OF ITEMS THAT MAY CONTRIBUTE TO A GOOD PORTRAYAL The overarching purpose of a good portrayal is to improve safety and efficiency.
To reach this goal, the following non-exhaustive list of items may be considered when determining user requirements: A defined area of interest Information that is provided when and where needed Standardization of portrayal configuration, which supports consistent application of operational procedures Role definition capabilities to support different portrayal profiles, such as Operators, Supervisors, and/or other users as required Ergonomic HMI considerations with the goal of reducing and mitigating operator fatigue, distraction, and other factors that may negatively impact overall safety and efficiency Minimizing non-essential administrative tasks in order to support the ability of the operator to focus upon critical tasks Where possible, automatic validation of data integrity should occur prior to presentation Minimal steps needed to navigate the shore-based equipment in order to retrieve the necessary information to assist in real-time decision making In a portrayal, a distinction should be made between operational alarms (related to navigation safety) and system alarms (related to technical deficiencies with the operating system).
These alarms should be configured and displayed in an appropriate manner to ensure that they are relevant to users A log of warnings and alarms should be maintained and readily accessible to the user A portrayal should not restrict the innovation of equipment manufacturers and unnecessarily interfere with the individual operational and risk-based requirements of individual shore-based Authorities A portrayal may also contain considerations regarding system failures and recovery, and if possible/appropriately describe business continuity measures A portrayal should consider local regulations considering storage and
