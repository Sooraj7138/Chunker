2.3. HISTORICAL DATA
Most, if not all, considerations regarding the technical aspects of information exchange (as covered in section 0) apply to the exchange of historical data as well.
3.1. INTRODUCTION
This chapter addresses the specific technical aspects of data exchange.
Each section addresses a particular aspect of the technical interface in more detail.
3.2.1. COMMUNICATION CHANNEL CHARACTERISTICS
The transfer of data between sender and receiver requires connectivity via a network.
A network comprises appropriate hardware and software interconnected by communication channels which may be wired or wireless.
Each communication channel has a limited capacity and characteristics that affect the speed at which data can be transferred.
The design of the data exchange should consider the characteristics of the underlying communication channel(s).
3.2.2. DATA MODELS
Exchange of information requires an understanding of how information is encoded, i.e., how data values are represented and an unambiguous description of their meaning (including the appropriate business context).
This is captured in a data model which describes:

3.2.2. DATA MODELS
the structure of the data in terms of data fields;

3.2.2. DATA MODELS

• the semantics of the data fields, including the appropriate context; and

3.2.2. DATA MODELS
the permissible ranges of a data field, including representation of invalid/not available data.
3.2.2. DATA MODELS
The IHO S-100 standard [9] (ISO 19xxx- series) is a specific framework standard for the development of data models for a variety of common and maritime-specific information.
S-100 data models are maintained in the IHO GI Registry and IALA was assigned its own section within this registry.
