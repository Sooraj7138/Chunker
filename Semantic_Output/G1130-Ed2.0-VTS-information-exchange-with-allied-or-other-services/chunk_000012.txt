3.5.1. CYBER SECURITY
It is recommended to adopt an appropriate cyber-security framework that defines the measures to safeguard uncompromised system operation and to prevent unauthorised access.
These measures may include:

3.5.1. CYBER SECURITY
revising system and network architecture;

3.5.1. CYBER SECURITY
reconsidering system access procedures for both internal and external users;

3.5.1. CYBER SECURITY

• establishing procedures to maintain software updated to the latest security patches, including software on network- and housekeeping devices;

3.5.1. CYBER SECURITY

• monitoring and validating system network dataflows; and

3.5.1. CYBER SECURITY
properly safeguarding legacy systems that are still in operation.
3.5.1. CYBER SECURITY
Where, traditionally, systems operated in closed environments, increasingly, VTS systems need to share data with external stakeholders.
This requires due consideration of authentication and authorisation of these external stakeholder, but also of measures to protect the data exchange as outlined in the following sections.
3.5.2. DATA CONFIDENTIALITY
The data exchanged between VTS, and allied or other services may have considerable business value and/or contain data that is privacy-sensitive.
Therefore, proper care should be taken to protect this data while stored and during transmission.
3.5.2. DATA CONFIDENTIALITY
It is recommended to use an appropriately secured transmission channel, e.g., a virtual private network (VPN), to avoid unauthorized access during data transmission.
Also, when sensitive data is stored, it may be appropriate to encrypt the data.
3.5.2. DATA CONFIDENTIALITY
Specific legal constraints may apply to data that can be related to the identity of persons.
3.5.3. DATA ACCESSIBILITY
Access to data should be properly governed, which means that proper procedures should be set-up to limit access to sensitive data to authorized personnel only.
3.5.4. AUDIT TRAILS
It may be appropriate to maintain audit trails of access to sensitive data.
Additionally, it may be necessary to attach audit trails to the sensitive data itself, e.g., recording all transactions that were executed with that particular data.
