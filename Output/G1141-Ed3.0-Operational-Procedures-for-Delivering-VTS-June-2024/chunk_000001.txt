correctly and that the provision of VTS is consistent globally; Ensure conformance with the entity’s policy and regulatory framework; Provide guidance for decision-making; and Streamline internal and external processes.
IMO Resolution A.1158(32) Guidelines for Vessel Traffic Services [2] states that: a.
Vessel traffic services are provided worldwide and make a valuable contribution to the safety of navigation, improved efficiency of traffic flow and the protection of the marine environment.
b.
The level of safety and efficiency in the movement of maritime traffic within an area covered by vessel traffic services is dependent upon close cooperation between those operating the vessel traffic services and participating ships.
c.
The use of differing procedures may cause confusion to ship masters, and that Vessel Traffic Services should be established and operated in a harmonized manner and in accordance with internationally approved guidelines.
PURPOSE OF THE DOCUMENT The purpose of this Guideline is to provide a framework for authorities to implement processes and procedures associated with the provision of VTS.
RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER DOCUMENTS IALA Guideline G1141 Operational procedures for Vessel Traffic Services [3] is associated with Recommendation R0127 (V-127) VTS Operations, a normative provision of IALA Standard S1040 Vessel Traffic Services (VTS)[4].
To demonstrate compliance with the Recommendation, the provisions of this Guideline need to be implemented.
Note: This Guidance should be read in conjunction with Recommendation R0132 Quality Management for Aids to Navigation Authorities (O-132) [5] and Guideline G1052 Quality Management Systems for AtoN Service Delivery [6], noting that G1052 states that documentation for the Quality Management System (QMS) should include, inter alia: Procedure documents, e.g., Operating guidelines, operating procedures, work instructions 
• Record keeping IALA Guideline G1141 Operational Procedures for Delivering VTS Edition 3.0 urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1141:ed3.0 P 5 CONTENT OF THE DOCUMENT The Guideline describes processes and procedures associated with: 
• Day-to-day operations to; 
• provide timely and relevant information on factors that may influence the vessel’s movements and assist onboard decision-making; 
• monitor and manage vessel traffic to ensure the safety and efficiency of vessel movements; and respond to developing unsafe situations.

• Management and administration to; 
• ensure the VTS operates in accordance with relevant international conventions and IMO instruments, IALA standards and national law; and 
• set operational objectives for the VTS that are consistent with improving safety and efficiency of vessel traffic and protection of the environment and routinely evaluating that they are being achieved.
These processes and procedures are separated into activities that are either internal or external to the VTS, and subsequently split into routine or emergency: 
• Internal Procedures – procedures that cover the day-to-day running of a VTS, including but not limited to the operation of systems and sensors, interactions among the staff and the internal management, etc.
External Procedures – procedures that cover the interaction with participating ships and allied services.
INTERNAL VTS PROCEDURES VTS authorities should implement processes and procedures for all internal activities related to the VTS.
A clear distinction should be made between routine and emergency activities as described below.
Recognizing that activities may vary between VTS, these may be further adapted to suit local needs.
4.1. ROUTINE PROCEDURES 4.1.1. DOCUMENT CONTROL Processes and procedures should be documented, regularly reviewed, and version control maintained.
These documents should be available to VTS personnel and form an integral part of training where adherence is routinely monitored.
Further, to achieve collaboration, it is recommended that these procedures (or part of them) may be shared with allied services.
GATHERING AND RECORDING OF INFORMATION Provision should be made for the storage, security, retrieval and presentation of this information.
This type of information may include: Communications (internal and/or external) Sensor data (i.e., data used to generate the traffic image such as radar, CCTV, AIS) IALA Guideline G1141 Operational Procedures for Delivering VTS Edition 3.0 urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1141:ed3.0 P 6 
• Vessel data and voyage information (e.g., vessel particulars, cargo data, including vessel movement information) 
• Meteorological and hydrographic data 
• Data from other sources The internal procedures should specify the time period for which VTS information is stored.
This time period should be such that it allows for the full retrieval of data post-incident/accident, in compliance with national requirements and those of the incident/accident investigation procedures of the VTS provider and other interested parties.
EQUIPMENT OPERATION, MAINTENANCE, CALIBRATION AND UPDATING All manuals and handbooks for equipment operation, maintenance (preventative and remedial), calibration and updating should be properly maintained and readily available to the appropriate personnel.
Key considerations include: 
• Descriptions of equipment and systems used in the VTS 
• Operation of equipment to cover all normal and emergency procedures 
• Determining performance availability criteria for equipment, including the availability of VTS during maintenance or other outages Categorization and prioritization of maintenance and defects Calibration of sensors within a specified tolerance level 
• Updates to equipment (hardware and software) and
