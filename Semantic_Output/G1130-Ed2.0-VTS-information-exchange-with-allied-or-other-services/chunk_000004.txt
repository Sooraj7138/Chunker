1.1. PREAMBLE
As outlined in IALA Guideline G1102 VTS Interaction with Allied or Other Services [9], a vessel traffic service (VTS) is recognized as a valuable asset to reduce incidents resulting from conflicts in vessel traffic.
Also, the role of VTS is well established, and its services are well positioned in the maritime domain.
1.1. PREAMBLE
It is recognized that information, collected by a VTS, could be used to support allied and other services in order to improve efficiency and reduce cost.
In addition, information from these parties could be useful for improving the VTS operation.
1.2. OBJECTIVE
As part of their operation, VTS providers compile a real-time picture of the maritime traffic within the VTS area and may also collect additional information pertaining to the traffic flow and the environment.
This information can assist allied or other services with their own tasks, and it is likely that allied or other services may have information that can assist a VTS provider.
1.2. OBJECTIVE
There may be situations where allied and other services collect the same data as the VTS provider but through independent means.
By establishing mutual agreements on the exchange of information, information only needs to be collected once.
