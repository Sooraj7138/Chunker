2.3. ALERTS AND INDICATORS
The use of different levels of alerts could increase the situational awareness for VTS operators.
In accordance with IALA Recommendation R0125, The Use and Presentation of Symbology at a VTS Centre [4], it is recommended that the terminology used for alerts (alarm, warning and caution) reflects the maritime standards contained in IMO Resolution A.1021(26) Code on alerts and indicators [2] unless particular local circumstances require otherwise.
