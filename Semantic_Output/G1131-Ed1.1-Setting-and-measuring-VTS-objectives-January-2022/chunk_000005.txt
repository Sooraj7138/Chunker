IMO MEMBER STATE AUDIT SCHEME (IMSAS) 2.1.3.
This Guideline states that:

IMO MEMBER STATE AUDIT SCHEME (IMSAS) 2.1.3.

• careful planning should be undertaken to ensure a VTS is implemented effectively, achieves its objectives and is sufficiently resourced and funded on an ongoing basis; and

IMO MEMBER STATE AUDIT SCHEME (IMSAS) 2.1.3.

• when planning and implementing a VTS a project management approach is recommended to ensure the major deliverables, assumptions and constraints are clearly documented.
This will assist in defining the scope of the VTS, its goals and objectives that need to be met.
Project management is considered as a discipline with the purpose to achieve specific goals and objectives by planning, organizing, motivating and controlling resources.

This Guideline states that to achieve the purposes for which it was implemented, a VTS:

IMO MEMBER STATE AUDIT SCHEME (IMSAS) 2.1.3.
“needs to be effective and routinely evaluated to ensure that the operational objectives are being met, the technical and operational performance is acceptable, and the issues identified and defined in determining the need for the VTS have been either alleviated or at least reduced to an acceptable level”.

3.1. WHAT ARE VTS OBJECTIVES?
A VTS Objective is a statement with direct and practical interpretation for management purposes and against which performance can be evaluated quantitatively (i.e., targets/thresholds) and measured practically.
In particular, it should:
