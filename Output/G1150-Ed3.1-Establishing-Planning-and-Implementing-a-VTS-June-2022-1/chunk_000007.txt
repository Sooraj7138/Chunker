Considerations when initiating and planning a VTS, and using the toolbox, may include: A.1. TRAFFIC DATA Information should be obtained on: traffic safety records; the complexity of traffic patterns; ship traffic densities, including traffic trends; any interference by vessel traffic with other marine-based activities; information on recent traffic surveys and evaluation of these surveys; 
• breakdown of all vessel traffic in terms of type and size of ships and categories of cargo carried, especially ships with hazardous and polluting cargoes; efficiency of maritime traffic flow; delays, causes and costs; congestion including location; and stakeholder feedback.
THE GEOGRAPHY OF THE AREA The maritime area should be defined and described in terms of geography.
The following areas should be considered: narrow and/or winding fairways; basins, piers and quays along the fairway; number, size, and location of anchorages; shallows, shifting shoals; navigation hazards such as wrecks, shallow water, or reefs; 
• protection of infrastructure such as locks, bridges, or offshore renewable energy installations (OREI); 
• established traffic routing measures such as traffic separation schemes (TSS), recommended routes and areas to be avoided); geology of the riverbed/seabed and shoreline; stability of the riverbed/seabed profile; routine dredging operations; 
• meteorological conditions (prevailing winds, fog, ice conditions, etc); hydrological conditions; and state of hydrographic surveys.
IALA Guideline G1150 Establishing, Planning and Implementing a VTS Edition 3.1 urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1150:ed3.1 P 14 PROTECTION OF THE MARINE ENVIRONMENT Elements to consider include: 
• whether the area concerned or part of it is a formally declared ’Particularly Sensitive Sea Area’ based on IMO Res.
A.720(17), as amended, or whether there are any sensitive areas in the proximity which may be affected by pollutants as a result of shipping accidents; 
• whether any fishing grounds and/or fish farms are involved; 
• other formal protection of the area based on either international, national or local rules and regulations e.g., whether the area is classified as a ’special area’ under MARPOL Annex 1; 
• records of marine pollution caused by shipping accidents, and the resulting damage to the economy and the environment in terms of clean-up costs, effects on wildlife, fish stocks and tourism; 
• whether there is an established national policy on the protection of the marine environment and any criteria set regarding pollution; 
• the views of the general public on the environmental issue and the marine environment in particular; and the availability of an emergency response organization to respond to a marine incident.
A.4. ACCIDENT AND INCIDENT DATA Information should be obtained on: 
• maritime accidents/incidents in the area, including information on the economic consequences; areas with a high frequency of accidents/incidents; results of accident/incident investigations; the recorded root causes of the accidents/incidents; 
• any recommendations contained in reports on accidents/incidents, and implementation status of these recommendations; the competency of the crew manning ships entering the area; and the opinions of stakeholders regarding traffic safety in the area.
A.5. VTS AREA Elements to consider include: delineating the VTS area and, if appropriate, VTS sub-areas or sectors; rules for ship traffic such as one-way traffic zones and hazardous cargo; 
• allocation of waterway space or management of infrastructure such as locks and bridges; types and sizes of ships required or expected to participate in the VTS; and adjacent VTS and/or ship reporting systems and co-ordination of operations/procedures.
A.6. MANAGEMENT Elements to consider include: the operating hours of the VTS; tasks to be performed by VTS personnel; IALA Guideline G1150 Establishing, Planning and Implementing a VTS Edition 3.1 urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1150:ed3.1 P 15 responsibilities of VTS personnel; health and safety considerations; structure of information flows; operational procedures; and physical security of the VTS centre and remote sites.
A.7. DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY Elements to consider include: system users and user requirements; 
• general outline for a VTS database; and, if appropriate, a general outline for means to retain and retrieve the traffic image, radio and other communication methods and other relevant information; 
• VTS equipment life cycle, warranty, and maintenance (including training for operational use and maintenance); basic functional design, including reliability and availability targets; 
• back-up and redundancy arrangements for critical equipment such as surveillance and communications equipment to meet reliability and availability targets; and 
• man/machine interface and human factors.
A.8. ALLIED SERVICES Support from allied services should be assessed in terms of their contributions, limitations and potential effectiveness, which may include: pilotage, including pilot boarding arrangements; availability of tug assistance; and 
• co-operation between authorities, allied
