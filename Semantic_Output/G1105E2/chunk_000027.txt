The portrayal should facilitate achieving an appropriate situational awareness and support effective decision-making;

6.4. INS
The portrayal should be designed for efficiency of operation and avoidance of information overload;

6.4. INS
Physical conditions and ergonomics are very important as are workload, shift arrangements and reserve capacity; and

6.4. INS
Human-centred design (HCD) and an ergonomic approach should be followed.
