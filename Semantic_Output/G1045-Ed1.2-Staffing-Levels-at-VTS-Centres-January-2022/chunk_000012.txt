2.9. INCIDENTS, ACCIDENTS AND OTHER EMERGENCIES
The potential for an incident or unexpected event to occur is always present.
Any incident within the VTS area or in the VTS Centre will create additional workload for the staff on duty – the more serious the incident, the greater the increase in workload.
2.9. INCIDENTS, ACCIDENTS AND OTHER EMERGENCIES
A staffing level that is only able to deal with the expected workload will certainly be overloaded when an incident, emergency or unexpected event occurs.
VTS Centres should have contingency plans to deal with internal and external incidents in the VTS area.
The activation and execution of these plans may have an effect on the staffing levels.
Appropriate arrangements should be part of any contingency plan.
Debriefing of these events contributes to the ability of the staff on duty to deal with them.
