8.2.2. LIMITATIONS
In Figure 5, the attached text information appears when the user clicks on the Virtual AIS AtoN symbol, in this example marking an artificial island.
The user can authenticate the Virtual AIS AtoN by the thin dashed line diamond along with the Virtual flag as active (Yes) in the text information.
8.2.2. LIMITATIONS
The ECDIS performance standard requires that overlay symbols be readily distinguishable from chart symbols.
Chart symbols for Virtual AIS AtoN have been developed and chart manufacturers are free to incorporate them according to the existing S-57 Appendix B.1 – Annex A (Edition 4.1.0) [14].
