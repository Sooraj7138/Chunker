1. INTRODUCTION
The use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to enhance the overall maritime surface picture allows for a more thorough assessment of the risk presented to the mariner.
As a consequence, decision making processes by Marine Aids to Navigation (AtoN) authorities will be assisted and will provide a documented record of an appropriate assessment of the volume of traffic and the degree of risk.

2. SCOPE
This document provides guidance on the use of GIS to assess the requirement and impact of AtoN in the area of interest.
It covers incorporation of charting overlays with new dangers and amplification of existing dangers.
Automatic Identification System (AIS) data will be used to determine traffic profile and volume.

2. SCOPE
An appropriate level of competence in marine navigation and familiarity in the area being assessed will be required to make full use of this tool.

2. SCOPE
This Guideline is a general guide only and is not intended to be a defined prescriptive document on the provision of AtoN using GIS.
For more technical advice, Guideline G1057 Use of Geographic Information Systems by Aids to Navigation Authorities should be consulted.

2. SCOPE
This Guideline introduces various potential applications for GIS data analysis to assist the AtoN authority to make a well informed decision based on all the quantitative and qualitative data available as well as using traditional methods of navigational analysis.
The options discussed are not an exhaustive list and the AtoN authority should always look to use any additional information available to them.
OVERVIEW OF GIS METHODOLOGY
Initial use of GIS to assist in the determination of AtoN requirements will normally begin with data being transposed onto a nautical chart layer of an appropriate scale to inform further analysis.
OVERVIEW OF GIS METHODOLOGY
Once the area of assessment is identified on the chart a series of layers can be used, including:

OVERVIEW OF GIS METHODOLOGY
Vessel traffic patterns using AIS data

OVERVIEW OF GIS METHODOLOGY
Leisure vessel data

OVERVIEW OF GIS METHODOLOGY
Fishing vessel data

OVERVIEW OF GIS METHODOLOGY
Existing and proposed offshore structures developments

OVERVIEW OF GIS METHODOLOGY
Up to date and historical hydrographic survey information

OVERVIEW OF GIS METHODOLOGY
Position, nominal range and sectors of visibility of lighthouses and beacons

OVERVIEW OF GIS METHODOLOGY
Position and type of AtoN

OVERVIEW OF GIS METHODOLOGY
The GIS will then be used to systematically show and remove layers, allowing for in depth study of all factors both in isolation and in combination with the other elements.
