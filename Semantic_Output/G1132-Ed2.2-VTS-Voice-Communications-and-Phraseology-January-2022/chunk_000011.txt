5.1. COMPILING A MESSAGE
The purpose of standard phraseology is to convey information or instructions unambiguously to a specific recipient or recipients.
Use of standard format and content will help to achieve this purpose.
5.1. COMPILING A MESSAGE
Standard phrases are identified in Part C for use in operational circumstances where time may be critical or where misunderstandings might compromize safety, however there will be many situations where such urgency does not apply and no standard phrase has been identified.
In such circumstances, plain language1 or locally adopted phrases should be used following the general guidance on phraseology below.
5.1.1. MESSAGE STRUCTURE
Message structure provides the framework to convey information or instructions unambiguously using a standard format and content structure.
5.1.1. MESSAGE STRUCTURE

5.1.1. MESSAGE STRUCTURE
Avoid unnecessary words (e.g., “what time do you think your ETA is at the pilot station, thank you”, should be: “what is your ETA at the pilot station”).
5.1.1. MESSAGE STRUCTURE
Keep the subject, verb, and object as near to one another as possible.
5.1.1. MESSAGE STRUCTURE

• Use the active form (such as “INFORMATION.
Ship BRAVO is overtaking you” instead of passive “INFORMATION.
You are being overtaken by ship BRAVO).
5.1.1. MESSAGE STRUCTURE

P 9

5.1.1. MESSAGE STRUCTURE
Each phrase should contain only one topic.
5.1.1. MESSAGE STRUCTURE

• A maximum of two message markers and two phrases should be used in one transmission to avoid an overload on the recipient.
5.1.1. MESSAGE STRUCTURE
Information must be relevant, as accurate as possible and timely.
5.1.1. MESSAGE STRUCTURE
•

5.1.1. MESSAGE STRUCTURE
Spell out words using the phonetic alphabet (Section 5.1.3) and use phonetic numbers (Section 5.1.4) as required for the names of buoys, stations, call signs etc.
5.1.1. MESSAGE STRUCTURE

• Ships should be clearly identified (e.g., by name and call sign) and it may also be beneficial to identify by ship type, for example “container ship Maersk Rotterdam”.
In many cases, the message element will be preceded by the identity of the ship about which information is being provided.
5.1.2. MESSAGE MARKERS
To facilitate shore-to-ship and ship-to-shore communications, message markers should be used to increase the probability of the purpose of the message being properly understood.
5.1.2. MESSAGE MARKERS
Message markers increase the effectiveness and urgency of VHF communications as required and may help emphasize the content of the message or to ensure that the message will be properly understood.
Whilst the use of message markers is not obligatory, their general use is good practice and VTS personnel should apply these depending on the assessment of the situation.
Their use is strongly recommended when a degree of stress or urgency exists, when there are language difficulties and when responding to unsafe situations.
5.1.2. MESSAGE MARKERS
There are eight message markers as defined in IMO Resolution A.918(22) Standard Marine Communication Phrases (SMCP) [2].
Seven of them are frequently used by VTS and are explained in more detail below.
The message marker should be spoken preceding the message or the corresponding part of the message.
