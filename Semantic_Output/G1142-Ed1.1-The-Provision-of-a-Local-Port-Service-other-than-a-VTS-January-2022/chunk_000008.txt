3.1. VESSEL TRAFFIC SERVICE (VTS)
A Vessel Traffic Service is a service implemented by a competent authority and should have the capability to interact with the traffic and to respond to traffic situations developing in the VTS area.
3.1. VESSEL TRAFFIC SERVICE (VTS)
A VTS is recognized internationally as a navigational safety measure through the International Convention on the Safety of Life at Sea 74/78 (SOLAS).
In particular, the provisions in SOLAS Chapter V (Safety of Navigation) Regulation 12 provides for Vessel Traffic Services and states that:

3.1. VESSEL TRAFFIC SERVICE (VTS)

• “Vessel Traffic Services (VTS) contribute to safety of life at sea, safety and efficiency of navigation and protection of the marine environment, adjacent shore areas, work sites and offshore installations from possible adverse effects of maritime traffic.”

3.1. VESSEL TRAFFIC SERVICE (VTS)

• “Contracting Governments undertake to arrange for the establishment of VTS where, in their opinion, the volume of traffic or the degree of risk justifies such services”.
3.1. VESSEL TRAFFIC SERVICE (VTS)
IMO Resolution A.1158(32) Guidelines for Vessel Traffic Services [5] describes the purpose of a VTS, the regulatory and legal framework, the VTS responsibilities of contracting governments, competent authorities and VTS providers, the requirements of participating ships in a VTS area and the general principles of a VTS.
3.1. VESSEL TRAFFIC SERVICE (VTS)
The establishment and on-going operation of a VTS is a considerable investment in terms of meeting the international obligations associated with establishing the services under national law and the equipment and associated qualifications and training for staff in both establishment and on-going operations.
3.1. VESSEL TRAFFIC SERVICE (VTS)
IALA Recommendation R0119 Establishment of a VTS [6] is a normative provision within IALA Standard S1040 Vessel Traffic Services [7]

3.1. VESSEL TRAFFIC SERVICE (VTS)
IALA Guideline G1150 [8] provides more detailed guidance on establishing, planning and implementing a VTS to attain the desired level of safety and efficiency of the maritime traffic in the area, noting the associated volume of traffic and degree of risk.
3.2. LOCAL PORT SERVICE
Where a Contracting Government is of the opinion that the navigational complexity, volume of traffic or the degree of risk does not justify exercising their rights to establish a VTS under provisions of SOLAS, there may be a need for information to be exchanged between ship and shore to ensure efficient handling of shipping and in-port processes.
In such circumstances, it is particularly important that mariners are left in no doubt that they are communicating with a local port service and not with a VTS.
3.2. LOCAL PORT SERVICE
Personnel providing such a local port service should restrict communications to the provision of basic factual information and avoid opinion, advice or instruction that might be provided through a VTS by personnel who have undertaken specialist VTS training.
3.2. LOCAL PORT SERVICE
The functions of a local port service may include:

3.2. LOCAL PORT SERVICE
Information relating to entry and departure such as:
