• Security and site access 
• Rules and regulations, for example: 
• Applicable rules and regulations, i.e.
required licenses (transmission, building etc.) 
• Business rules IALA Guideline G1111 Establishing Functional and Performance Requirements for VTS Systems and Equipment Edition 2.0 urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1111:ed2.0 P 8 ® 
• Organization, for example: 
• Administrative functions and roles 
• Authorization levels Any VTS system should, as a minimum, be equipped with means to build a VTS traffic image as well as providing reliable communications.
The system architecture of a VTS system should carefully consider issues such as, but not be limited to: 
• Network requirements (bandwidth, latency etc.) 
• Redundant data paths 
• Data integrity Security requirements, e.g., physical security, cyber security 
• Data storage 
• Reporting and recording requirements 
• Maintenance of the VTS System and its equipment In addition, the system architecture should have built-in flexibility for future upgrades and have the capability to be maintained without impacting routine VTS operations.
During the development of the system architecture, comprehensive site surveys should be performed, including but not limited to the above considerations.
Involvement of relevant stakeholders in the site survey early in the process adds value and ensures awareness of the potential risks (e.g., design and performance).
3.1. AVAILABILITY AND RELIABILITY The VTS provider should define an overall availability and reliability target for the VTS system, including the elements to be considered based on the risk assessment results.
The relationship between downtime and availability figures is given by Table 
1. Table 1 Relationship between downtime and availability Availability Annual downtime 87.6 hours 24 hours 8 hours 4 hours Corresponding Availability 99% 99.7% 99.9% 99.95% The VTS provider can decide whether individual sub-systems are critical or non-critical.
Non-critical sub-systems may be excluded from the overall system availability requirement.
Note that multiple means of communications and overlapping sensor coverage will increase overall availability.
Such a solution may result in reduced requirements for the availability of each item of equipment individually.
Scheduled maintenance activities may be included in availability figures.
Also note that required spare parts should be readily available, to ensure the shortest time to repair.
Therefore, VTS providers should plan for sufficient spare parts and service arrangements, or business continuation plans in order to meet the availability criteria.
The VTS system availability may be improved by the following redundancy measures: IALA Guideline G1111 Establishing Functional and Performance Requirements for VTS Systems and Equipment Edition 2.0 urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1111:ed2.0 P 9 ai ww 
• by duplicating hardware and/or by using externally hosted VTS system and equipment - in duplicated hardware systems, hand-over procedures from active to stand-by equipment should be considered; by siting sensors such as radio and radar aerials to provide partial overlapping coverage; and by facilitating gradual reduction of capabilities in individual VTS Equipment.
3.2. RECORDING, ARCHIVING AND REPLAY Within legal limitations, provision should be made for secure storage, retrieval and presentation of VTS data so the relevant historical data can be easily recalled and played back.
The data retention period should allow for the full retrieval of data post-incident/accident, in compliance with national requirements and those of the investigation procedures.
Stored and archived data should include, but not be limited to: 
• VTS traffic image 
• Sensor data 
• Voice communication 
• Other relevant information It may also include (within legal limitations): Internal VTS personnel conversations inside the VTS centre 
• VTS personnel activities 
• Technical and maintenance requirements, e.g., logging, failure tracking, long term failure statistics and analysis, system performance monitoring and improvement The data should be recorded automatically and be capable of replay without impact to on-going VTS operations.
Synchronization of information is recommended for replay.
Data security should always be considered especially when providing online storage.
Long term archiving may be considered for traffic statistics, risks evaluation, strategic planning etc.
3.3. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS 3.3.1. The VTS provider should specify the local environmental conditions for VTS system performance, design and outdoor installations.
EQUIPMENT SHELTERS 3.3.2. A shelter can provide a protective environment with characteristics that depend on the location and design of the shelter.
In situations where contained equipment is reliant on the environment created by the shelter, the shelter facilities (e.g., cooling or heating) may become critical to the achieved availability of the equipment.
LIGHTNING PROTECTION 3.3.3. Lightning protection is often subject to national or local legislation taking into account local conditions, severity, earth conductivity, power grid constraints etc.
The guidance from country to country differs depending on lightning strike frequency and severity.
As a consequence, requirements for the number and type of lightning arrestors, the number of earthing points and the minimum cross sectional area of conductors vary to suit local conditions.
