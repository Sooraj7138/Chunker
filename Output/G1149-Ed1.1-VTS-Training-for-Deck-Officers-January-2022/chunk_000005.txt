The objective of the familiarization is to explain the purpose of VTS to the deck officer, thereby enhancing VTS awareness.
To achieve the objective, familiarization activities should be structured, and may use a workbook or other process.
The familiarization activity may include: 
• Equipment used 
• Procedures followed Legal and regulatory requirements of the VTS 
• How the VTS monitors and interacts with traffic in the VTS area Joint case study reviews 
• How the deck officer can work most effectively with the VTS FAMILIARIZATION BETWEEN ALLIED SERVICES AND VTS 6.7. The involvement of allied services, including pilots, in the work of the VTS will promote the safety of navigation in the VTS area.
Therefore, the above familiarization activities may also be of benefit for the providers of such allied services.
