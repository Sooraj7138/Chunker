VTS operation.
d) Quality Management IALA Recommendation R0132 Quality Management for Aids to Navigation Authority (O-132) [14] is the main reference document to be utilized for establishing a quality management system (QMS) process at VTS Centres.
Additionally, the following documents are also relevant for operational consideration with regards to quality management: IALA Guideline G1101 Auditing and Assessing a VTS IALA Guideline G1115 Preparing for the IMO Audit Scheme (IMSAS) on a VTS; and 
• IALA VTS Manual [15].
Examples of objectives that contribute to achieving the operational considerations are provided at annex A.

4. SETTING GUIDELINES TO MEASURE OBJECTIVES Once the objectives for the VTS have been set a process should be implemented to ensure they are being met.
4.1. MEASURING THE OBJECTIVES To monitor and assess that the objectives set for the VTS are met, measures need to be determined.
This is to identify that the VTS is effectively contributing to alleviate, or at least reducing to an acceptable level and the issues /problems the VTS was introduced to mitigate (e.g., risk of collisions/groundings, navigational hazards, complexity of waterway).
Both positive (leading) and negative (lag) performance measures should be considered.
This ensures that operational outcomes are measured in terms of the success of good practice and the preventative measures that need to be implemented.
IALA Guideline G1131 Setting and Measuring VTS Objectives Edition 1.1 urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1131:ed1.1 P 7 4.2. DEFINING PERFORMANCE MEASURES When testing the suitability of key performance measures the following issues should be considered: 
• Are they relevant?

• Are they clearly defined?

• Are they readily measurable?
Are they acceptable to people across the organization?
Are they comparable from one measurement to the next?

• Are they unambiguous?

• Are they statistically valid?
Can it be collected in a timely and cost‐effective manner?
This should lead to a set of measures which: Accurately and consistently measure the parameter to monitor.

• Are easily understood by users.

• Are relatively simple to collect.

• Are timely in that they support Authorities to identify and implement a response that can influence the outcome.
Readily relate to the objectives of the organization.
4.3. REVIEW It is important for the competent authority/VTS provider to regularly assess the VTS to ensure that the VTS operational objectives have been met and the problems identified and defined in the Planning and Implementing phase have been either alleviated or at least reduced to an acceptable level.
Refer to IALA Guideline G1150 Establishing, Planning and Implementing a VTS and IALA Guideline G1018 Risk Management [16].
