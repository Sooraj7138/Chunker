services, adjacent VTS centres, or other similar organizations to increase knowledge of operations in the VTS area.

• Regular updates of regulatory, procedural and technological developments.

• Attendance and participation in relevant emergency, business continuity, fail over or operational procedural exercises.

• Workplace safety, including induction and first aid courses.
Where appropriate, practical activities may be accompanied by a workbook in which the learning goal of the activity is linked to several questions, thereby enhancing the learning and integration of this experience into their role.
9.3. REVALIDATION TRAINING Revalidation training is the periodic, structured training designed to refresh, maintain, and enhance skills, knowledge and competencies of VTS personnel, ensuring the ongoing validity of their VTS qualifications.
IALA Guideline G1156 Recruitment, Training and Certification of VTS Personnel Edition 2.0 urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1156:ed2.0 P 19 Revalidation training provides a mechanism to: 
• Focus on the retention of critical skills and knowledge to ensure VTS personnel can continue to perform in their roles effectively.

• Refresh specific skills, particularly those that may degrade over time without use.

• Assess the competency of VTS personnel through a structured and standardised programme.
Competent Authorities are responsible for ensuring that revalidation training is carried out at intervals of between three to five years, and for providing guidance on how revalidation training may be delivered.
This guidance can include, for example, the use of structured courses, simulation exercises, or other approved formats.
VTS providers should have processes and procedures in place to ensure that VTS personnel complete revalidation training within the timeframes and guidance provided by the competent authority.
Where VTS personnel hold additional qualifications, such as VTS supervisors or OJT instructors, they are expected to maintain the competencies required for these roles.
Competent Authorities may determine the revalidation requirements, which could include attending a structured revalidation course aligned with the original model course (e.g.
C0103-2 and C0103-4) or other comparable approaches such as: 
• Demonstrating continued competence through active supervisory duties or instructional activities.

• Participation in relevant professional development activities (e.g.
leadership, crisis management, decision-making, coaching, or instructional design), or 
• Using other approved methods that ensure continued competence in leadership, mentoring, and assessment.
Revalidation training may be delivered either by an accredited VTS Training Organization, or a VTS provider approved to provide revalidation training for their own personnel.
It is acknowledged that, depending on how the training program is structured, both an accredited VTS Training Organization and the VTS provider may be involved in developing and delivering training activities.
IALA Model Course C0103-5 Revalidation training for VTS Personnel provides further guidance on how this training may be established.
9.4. UNSTRUCTURED LEARNING Unstructured (sometimes called informal) learning occurs through everyday on-the-job experiences, interactions, and activities, without the need for formal training programs or instruction.
It is typically unplanned and spontaneous, where individuals gain knowledge, skills, or insights through: 
• On-the-job learning where new skills or knowledge are gained by observing, trying tasks themselves, or receiving guidance from others.

• Peer discussions where insights are informally exchanged such as in the review and analysis of lessons learned from local VTS operations or incidents.

• Self-directed learning where an individual explores new topics, skills, or tools on their own, such as reading articles, watching videos/tutorials, or experimenting with software functionality.

• Trial and error where skills are gained by experimenting with different approaches, learning from mistakes, and improving through repeated practice.
IALA Guideline G1156 Recruitment, Training and Certification of VTS Personnel Edition 2.0 urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1156:ed2.0 P 20 VTS CAREER PROGRESSION The formal recognition of VTS qualifications provides the foundation for a professional framework similar to that adopted by the shipping and pilotage industry.
The regular revalidation of these qualifications seeks to create quality standards comparable to other professions.
VTS personnel have the scope for career progression by making use of the skills and experience gained, in either VTS, or other maritime environments (see example in Figure 2).
