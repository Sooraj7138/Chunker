1. SCOPE This Guideline aims at defining a special application of measures and procedures for establishing and managing vessel traffic in particular areas where limitations to normal navigation may need to be or have been established and the role of a VTS therein.
This can be both on a permanent or temporary basis.
In order to better consider the effects or impact to shipping the VTS authority should participate in the process of establishing and managing any kind of restrictions to navigation.
The purpose of this Guideline is to assist VTS authorities in defining appropriate procedures to manage traffic around and inside areas with particular restrictions to navigation.
ROLE OF A VTS IN ESTABLISHING A RESTRICTED OR LIMITED ACCESS AREA A comprehensive risk assessment should be carried out before establishing a restricted or limited access area, and in the establishing of the appropriate measures.
An authority other than a VTS may have the responsibility for establishing a restricted or limited access area (e.g., Harbour Master, Coastguard, Ministry of Environment), however the VTS should have a consultative or supportive role in the establishment process of such areas.
As VTS has the most expertise and experience regarding traffic movement in its area, it should advise the establishing authority about the consequences for shipping and for the access to harbours.
In some cases, a VTS authority may advise that establishing such an area is not appropriate.
The VTS authority can provide an analysis of statistical traffic data and of potential dangerous situations that may occur in the area concerned to inform the risk assessment process and to evaluate the consequences related to shipping interests and/or the goods to be protected (e.g., shipping, human, environment, offshore installations, etc.) in terms of frequency and outcome.
Consideration must be given to the location of the area, in particular, the applicability of legislation (e.g., UNCLOS).
A VTS should also participate in the evaluation process so that adjustments can be made to the areas/limitations.
While assessing the need to establish restrictions to navigation, responsible authorities should consider the necessity to make modifications to an existing VTS system or even to establish a new one, in order to minimize all the risks to as low as reasonably practicable.
For example, this may include an increase in the VTS area, installation of new equipment and changes to the services that the VTS provides.
ROLE OF A VTS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF A RESTRICTED OR LIMITED ACCESS AREA 
3. In circumstances where the risk related to navigation is increased, VTS is one of the most efficient instruments through which such a risk may be dealt with in order to reduce it to an acceptable level.
The objectives are protecting the traffic through monitoring, enforcing the regulations, protecting the marine environment and the interests of other authorities, stakeholders and third parties.
To this end, it may be necessary to adopt particular provisions such as to: Impose specific navigation measures (e.g., recommended route).
Implement specific reporting obligations.
Arrange for the exchange of related information with other organizations involved.

• Monitor/co-ordinate safety zone.
Insert boundary co-ordinates and set appropriate alarms for the area.

• Update existing operating procedures.
Arrange appropriate response measures.
Provide information of violations to enforcement authorities.

• Assist in the prevention of unauthorized access.
Establish a ship safety zone around a certain vessel.
Promulgate the existence of such area to shipping and relevant authorities.
Examples of such areas are listed in annex A and examples of VTS management tools for these areas in annex B.
