10.2.1. GNSS VULNERABILITY
Ships may lose their positioning capability when the GNSS service is lost due to jamming or interference unless they have an alternative positioning system.
Poor installation or failure of shipborne equipment can similarly interfere with or degrade GNSS reception which could lead to a loss of the Virtual AtoN or a positional offset of the AIS AtoN symbol (more details in section c).
10.2.2. SPOOFING AND JAMMING OF VIRTUAL ATON
Some spoofing methods can be detected through careful monitoring of the transmission channel.
One possibility is to monitor MMSI numbers within the service coverage area.
Duplicated or non-existent MMSI numbers within the coverage area may indicate spoofing.

10.2.2. SPOOFING AND JAMMING OF VIRTUAL ATON
Increased spoofing detection capability can be achieved through regional co-operation between neighbouring countries, exchanging valid MMSI numbers and co-operating on identifying invalid MMSI numbers, for example, handing over MMSI numbers from one competent authority to another competent authority when vessels cross the administrative boundaries of these authorities.
Such a scheme is implemented on the administrative boundary between the Malacca and Singapore Straits.
10.2.2. SPOOFING AND JAMMING OF VIRTUAL ATON
Competent authorities who provide Virtual AtoN services should maintain a database of all valid MMSI numbers assigned to Virtual AtoN.
This database should be shared with such stakeholders as neighbouring countries.
10.2.2. SPOOFING AND JAMMING OF VIRTUAL ATON
Both spoofing and jamming can compromise and/or shut down a Virtual AtoN service.
Jamming will typically block the service in a certain geographic region.
Spoofing is more sinister since the targeted receiver cannot detect the deception (i.e., the signal appears to be genuine), which could mislead the navigator.
