• may lead to considerable cost savings.
1.2. OBJECTIVE
This Guideline describes, from a technical point of view, the issues to be considered and the principles to be applied for interaction between VTS and allied or other services.
2.1. THE TECHNICAL INTERFACE
Guideline G1102 contains an overview of allied and other services that may want to exchange information with a VTS.
It also provides guidance on setting up an agreement to cover the operational and legal aspects of the information exchange.
This will, in general, include a service level agreement which will have an impact on the technical realization.
Additionally, an agreement should be made on the specific technical aspects of the information exchange.
2.1. THE TECHNICAL INTERFACE
The technical aspects of information exchange should be consolidated in a technical interface description.
Where possible, applicable standards, such as S-100, should be considered and used.
The technical interface is mostly determined by the type and timing aspects of the information.
So, it is possible that the same technical interface applies to information exchange with different allied or other services.
2.1. THE TECHNICAL INTERFACE
As far as VTS information is concerned, the following types of data could be exchanged:

2.1. THE TECHNICAL INTERFACE
1 Voyage related data, containing information on past, present and future voyages of vessels and their cargo

2.1. THE TECHNICAL INTERFACE
Traffic image data, containing information on the position, speed and identity of vessels
