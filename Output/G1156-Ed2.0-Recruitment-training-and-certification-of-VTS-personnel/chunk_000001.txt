2. DOCUMENT PURPOSE The purpose of this document is to provide guidance on implementing practices associated with the recruitment, training, assessment and certification of VTS personnel in a manner consistent with the IMO Guidelines for Vessel Traffic Services and the IALA standards, recommendations, guidelines and model courses.
This Guideline is associated with IALA Recommendation R0103 (V-103) Training and Certification of VTS Personnel [3], a normative provision of IALA Standard 1050 Training and Certification.
To demonstrate compliance with the recommendation, the practices described in this guideline should be taken into account.
INTERNATIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR VTS TRAINING IMO Resolution A.1158(32) on Guidelines for Vessel Traffic Services states that: 
• 5.2.3 The competent authority for VTS should ensure that VTS training is approved and VTS personnel are certified.

• 5.3.4 The VTS provider should ensure that a VTS is adequately staffed and that VTS personnel are appropriately trained and qualified.

• 8.2 VTS personnel should only be considered competent when appropriately trained and qualified for their VTS duties.
This includes: satisfactorily completing generic VTS training approved by a competent authority; 
• satisfactorily completing on-the-job training at the VTS where the personnel are employed; 
• undergoing periodic assessments and revalidation training to ensure competence is maintained; and being in possession of appropriate certification.
IALA Guideline G1156 Recruitment, Training and Certification of VTS Personnel Edition 2.0 urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1156:ed2.0 P 5 IALA Standard S1050 Training and Certification specifies the practices associated with the training and assessment of VTS personnel.

4. VTS PERSONNEL VTS personnel are defined in IMO Resolution A.1158(32) as Persons performing tasks associated with vessel traffic services, trained in vessel traffic services operations and appropriately qualified.
VTS personnel are individuals that are appropriately trained and qualified in VTS operations in accordance with the relevant model course associated with their functions.
They actively contribute to the safe and efficient movement of vessel traffic in conjunction with the bridge team and allied services.
Whilst the composition/types of roles for personnel in each VTS may vary, the roles generally consist of: 
• VTS operator; 
• VTS supervisor; and 
• On-the-job training (OJT) instructor A VTS provider may also establish a VTS manager position.
Detailed job descriptions for VTS personnel should be developed focusing on the functions, objectives and responsibilities of the VTS.

4.2. VTS SUPERVISOR The VTS provider may establish VTS supervisor positions, or assign supervisory functions, to assist in the day-to-day management and co-ordination of the operational activities of the VTS centre.

The VTS manager should be familiar with operations in the VTS area, the tasks performed by the VTS personnel, and interactions with allied services and other stakeholders.
