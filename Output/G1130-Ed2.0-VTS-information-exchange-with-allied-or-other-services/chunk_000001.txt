which will have an impact on the technical realization.
Additionally, an agreement should be made on the specific technical aspects of the information exchange.
The technical aspects of information exchange should be consolidated in a technical interface description.
Where possible, applicable standards, such as S-100, should be considered and used.
The technical interface is mostly determined by the type and timing aspects of the information.
So, it is possible that the same technical interface applies to information exchange with different allied or other services.
As far as VTS information is concerned, the following types of data could be exchanged: 1 Voyage related data, containing information on past, present and future voyages of vessels and their cargo Traffic image data, containing information on the position, speed and identity of vessels IALA Guideline G1130 Technical Aspects of Information Exchange Between VTS and Allied or Other Services Edition 2.0 urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1130:ed2.0 e P 4 3 Surveillance sensor data, such as radar, Automatic Identification System (AIS) and Electro Optic System (EOS) Meteorological, geographical and hydrographical information Voice communication data such as VHF, and telephone.
Note, for Items 1 and 2 the reader is referred to IALA Recommendation R0145 Inter-VTS Exchange Format Service (V-145), which defines an appropriate standard Another important factor to consider, when defining a technical interface, is timing.
This factor can be further divided into: Real-time, i.e., data that changes on a timeframe in a matter of seconds.

• Non-real-time, data that changes on a timeframe in a matter of minutes: 
• Static/semi-static, pertinent data or data that changes infrequently 
• Historical, i.e., recorded data 2.2. DEFINING THE TECHNICAL INTERFACE At least, the following aspects should be considered when defining the technical interface: The data format, i.e., how will the information be represented: 
• Communication channel characteristics 
• Data model, including semantics 
• Version control Timing of the information exchange: 
• Messaging pattern 
• Time stamping 
• Availability and data integrity: 
• Availability of equipment and services 
• Availability of data 
• Data integrity 
• Security of the information: 
• Data confidentiality 
• Data accessibility 
• Audit trails 2.3. HISTORICAL DATA VTS and allied or other services may be legally required to maintain records of historical data.
There may also be other uses of historical data, e.g., to gather statistics for strategic decision making or for research purposes.
When exchanging historical data, special consideration should be given to: The data to be retained, which could be a subset of the available data.

Adequate storage capacity to cover the required time period.

• Facilities for searching through and providing access to historical data.
Most, if not all, considerations regarding the technical aspects of information exchange (as covered in section 0) apply to the exchange of historical data as well.

3. TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF INTERACTION WITH ALLIED OR OTHER SERVICES 3.1. INTRODUCTION This chapter addresses the specific technical aspects of data exchange.
Each section addresses a particular aspect of the technical interface in more detail.
3.2. DATA FORMAT 3.2.1. COMMUNICATION CHANNEL CHARACTERISTICS The transfer of data between sender and receiver requires connectivity via a network.
A network comprises appropriate hardware and software interconnected by communication channels which may be wired or wireless.
Each communication channel has a limited capacity and characteristics that affect the speed at which data can be transferred.
The design of the data exchange should consider the characteristics of the underlying communication channel(s).
3.2.2. DATA MODELS Exchange of information requires an understanding of how information is encoded, i.e., how data values are represented and an unambiguous description of their meaning (including the appropriate business context).
This is captured in a data model which describes: the structure of the data in terms of data fields; 
• the semantics of the data fields, including the appropriate context; and the permissible ranges of a data field, including representation of invalid/not available data.
The IHO S-100 standard [9] (ISO 19xxx- series) is a specific framework standard for the development of data models for a variety of common and maritime-specific information.
S-100 data models are maintained in the IHO GI Registry and IALA was assigned its own section within this registry.
3.2.2.1. Version Control Version control procedures should be established to allow additions to and/or further development of the technical interface.
Preferably, versioning should be defined as a part of the technical interface.
3.3. TIMING 3.3.1. MESSAGING PATTERN Different messaging patterns may be used, depending on the specific data sharing requirements.
In particular, data may be sent from one sender to exactly one receiver or from one sender to many receivers.
The following patterns are most common: IALA Guideline G1130 Technical Aspects of Information Exchange Between VTS and Allied
