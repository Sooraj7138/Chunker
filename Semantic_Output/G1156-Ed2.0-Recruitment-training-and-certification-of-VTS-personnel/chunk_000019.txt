VTS ENGLISH COMMUNICATIONS COMPETENCY TESTING
VTS Communications competency tests are designed to monitor that VTS personnel continue to conform with the practices for VTS communications as outlined in IMO Standard Marine Communication Phrases (SMCP)[4] and IALA G1132 on VTS Voice Communications and Phraseology [16].
VTS ENGLISH COMMUNICATIONS COMPETENCY TESTING
VTS providers should monitor that VTS personnel continue to conform with the practices for VTS communications as outlined in IMO Standard Marine Communication Phrases (SMCP) and IALA G1132.

VTS ENGLISH COMMUNICATIONS COMPETENCY TESTING
IALA Guideline on VTS English Communication Competency Testing [13] provides a framework for VTS providers to assess competency with standard message structure and phrases.
SKILLS AND DEVELOPMENT TRAINING
Skills and development training focuses on building the abilities needed to perform tasks proficiently.
This includes being able to keep up with changes in technology, regulations, or the operating environment as well ensuring VTS personnel can apply this knowledge effectively into real-world scenarios.
SKILLS AND DEVELOPMENT TRAINING
VTS providers should determine the type of training required for their operations to build the skills, knowledge and capabilities of their VTS personnel.
The common types of training are:

SKILLS AND DEVELOPMENT TRAINING

• Adaption Training

SKILLS AND DEVELOPMENT TRAINING

• Updating Training

SKILLS AND DEVELOPMENT TRAINING

• Other Training

SKILLS AND DEVELOPMENT TRAINING
To identify specific skills gaps and development needs for VTS personnel it is recommended that a training needs analysis should be undertaken.
Annex A provides an example of how a training needs analysis for an individual may be completed.
9.2.1. ADAPTATION TRAINING
Adaptation training is carried out whenever significant changes to VTS operations are expected or when changes have been made, concerning equipment, regulations, operational procedures or any other matter which is relevant to the performance of VTS personnel.
9.2.1. ADAPTATION TRAINING
This training should preferably be delivered before any changes occur to ensure smooth implementation of the changes.
9.2.1. ADAPTATION TRAINING
Adaptation training should be tailored to each situation, considering the complexity and nature of the change.
Key considerations include:

9.2.1. ADAPTATION TRAINING

• Designing and developing appropriate training.
9.2.1. ADAPTATION TRAINING

• Preparing a structured program with detailed lesson plans and clear learning objectives based on the training needs analysis.
9.2.1. ADAPTATION TRAINING
•

9.2.1. ADAPTATION TRAINING
Identifying the most suitable party to develop and deliver the training, which could be in-house, a training organization, a service provider (e.g.
the company installing VTS equipment), or a combination of these.
9.2.1. ADAPTATION TRAINING

• Developing assessment approach suitable to the training provided.
9.2.1. ADAPTATION TRAINING
9.2.2. UPDATING TRAINING

9.2.1. ADAPTATION TRAINING
Updating training is a tailored made program aimed at refreshing or improving specific areas of competency.
It allows VTS personnel to regain professional knowledge and skills, while reinforcing previous training.
9.2.1. ADAPTATION TRAINING

9.2.1. ADAPTATION TRAINING
VTS providers should establish processes and procedures to identify when updating training is required to ensure VTS personnel maintain competency and may be required in circumstances such as:

9.2.1. ADAPTATION TRAINING
a break in service

9.2.1. ADAPTATION TRAINING

• an unsatisfactory performance assessment or proficiency check

9.2.1. ADAPTATION TRAINING

• upon request

9.2.1. ADAPTATION TRAINING

• when deemed necessary by the VTS provider

9.2.1. ADAPTATION TRAINING
When an event triggers the need for updating training, a training needs analysis should be conducted to identify performance gaps, establish training goals, and define the required performance levels.
9.2.1. ADAPTATION TRAINING
Before the training begins, VTS personnel should be informed about the program's objectives, duration, and format.
For example, after a break in service of three months or more, a VTS provider could conduct a training needs analysis to determine if updating training is necessary, considering recent changes, the complexity of the VTS area and the individual's duties.
9.2.1. ADAPTATION TRAINING
Updating training may cover both generic and area-specific competency elements.
These training activities may be enhanced through the use of case studies and by incorporating simulation exercises tailored to specific tasks performed by VTS personnel.
These exercises can range from low-level simulation approaches, such as role-playing scenarios, to full mission options that utilise interactive computer-based simulations [13].
The exercises may cover various areas, including:

9.2.1. ADAPTATION TRAINING

• Responding to developing unsafe situations

9.2.1. ADAPTATION TRAINING

• Emergency response to equip individuals with the skills and knowledge necessary to respond effectively to emergencies by ensuring safety and preparedness in crisis situations.
9.2.1. ADAPTATION TRAINING

• Joint operation exercises involving multiple parties such as VTS, tugs, pilots, response agencies are involved.
9.2.1. ADAPTATION TRAINING
VTS providers need to identify who would be best positioned to develop and deliver update training, whether in-house, through a Training Organization or a combination of both.
9.2.3. OTHER TRAINING
Other training may be designed to address the specific learning needs and requirements of personnel at a particular VTS, ensuring they remain competent for their duties.
These programs may focus on area-specific competencies, tools, and procedures relevant to the immediate work environment, such as:

9.2.3. OTHER TRAINING

• Familiarization trips on vessels with pilots or other stakeholders, visits to allied services, adjacent VTS centres, or other similar organizations to increase knowledge of operations in the VTS area.
9.2.3. OTHER TRAINING

• Regular updates of regulatory, procedural and technological developments.
9.2.3. OTHER TRAINING

• Attendance and participation in relevant emergency, business continuity, fail over or operational procedural exercises.
9.2.3. OTHER TRAINING

• Workplace safety, including induction and first aid courses.
9.2.3. OTHER TRAINING
Where appropriate, practical activities may be accompanied by a workbook in which the learning goal of the activity is linked to several questions, thereby enhancing the learning and integration of this experience into their role.
