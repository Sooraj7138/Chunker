PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTING
The implementation and operation of a VTS to improve the safety and efficiency of navigation, safety of life at sea and the protection of the marine environment is a significant investment.
Careful planning should be undertaken to ensure a VTS is implemented effectively, achieves its objectives and is sufficiently resourced and funded on an ongoing basis.
PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTING
When planning and implementing a VTS, a project management approach is recommended to ensure the major deliverables, assumptions and constraints are clearly documented.
This will assist in defining the scope of the VTS, its goals and objectives that need to be met.
Project management is considered as a discipline with the purpose to achieve specific goals and objectives by planning, organizing, motivating, and controlling resources.
PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTING

• Relevant international guidance prepared and published by appropriate international organizations regarding project management should be considered, or where there are national requirements for project management, these should be used.
PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTING
ISO 21500, Guidance on Project Management [9] is an international standard issued by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).
PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTING
In summary, the standard:

PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTING

• Provides high-level description of concepts and processes that are considered to form good practice in project management.
PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTING

• Can be used by any type of organization, including public, private or community organizations, and for any type of project, irrespective of complexity, size, or duration.
PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTING
Project management is undertaken in phases in order to improve control and quality.
At the end of each phase, a review is typically conducted on the deliverables as well as on the performance of the project team.
This helps the team ascertain whether the project proceeds to the next phase or undergoes revision.
PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTING
This section provides an overview of the five project management phases and the key areas for consideration as they relate to VTS:

PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTING

1. PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTING
Initiating - This marks the beginning of the project.
The goal of this phase is to define the project at a broad level and develop a business case.
PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTING

2. Planning - During this phase, the scope and goals of the project are defined, and a project management plan is developed.
It involves identifying the cost, quality, available resources, and a realistic timetable.
PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTING
Implementing - This is the phase where deliverables are developed and completed.
PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTING

4. Controlling – This phase is invariably carried out simultaneously with phase 3 (Implementing), thereby ensuring that project objectives and deliverables are met.
This phase is about measuring project progression and performance and ensuring that everything happening aligns with the project management plan.
PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTING

5. Closing - The closing processes are used to formally establish that the project phase or project is finished.
