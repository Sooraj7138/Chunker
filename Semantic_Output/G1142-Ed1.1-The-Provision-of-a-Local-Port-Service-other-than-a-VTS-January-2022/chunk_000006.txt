1. INTRODUCTION
Passive traffic management measures do not involve communication/interaction with the mariner from the shore.

1. INTRODUCTION
In contrast, a local port service generally involves voice communication between the entity ashore and the mariner.
In these situations, it is important that mariners are in no doubt as to whether they are communicating with a VTS, which can be expected to provide all the associated functions of a VTS, or whether they are communicating with an entity providing only information concerned with the management of the port or facility.
It is unlikely that staff operating a local port service will have been trained to the standards required by a VTS.

1. INTRODUCTION
It is, therefore, considered best practice for Contracting Governments/competent authorities to ensure that a clear differentiation exists between a VTS and a local port service, and that this is clearly communicated to mariners.
