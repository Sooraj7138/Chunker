categorized for the various users as required.
The portrayal of IALA information onboard ships or ashore does not have to be identical.
However, there is benefit to all users if information is displayed in a consistent and unambiguous manner.
This includes the use of standard symbology, icons, and colour schemes as to be defined in IHO GI Registry (S-100 Registry).
Displaying too much supplemental information can obscure critical information or lead to confusion.
As such users should be able to determine the volume or types of non-critical information on the display for their operating tasks and navigational decision making processes.
The portrayal should allow a user to control the system, input data and take action efficiently.
Where possible, the portrayal should indicate invalid and erroneous user input.
The portrayal should be able to display and log significant events.
The portrayal should support the playback of recorded data.

It should be noted that the examples of portrayal referred to may be subject to change due to developments.
CURRENT PRESENTATION/DISPLAY STANDARDS The following is a list of shipborne and shore based equipment, systems, and services based on what is mentioned in existing SOLAS V/19 & 20, IMO MSC, IMO NAV,3 and IALA related documents.
The existing standards should be considered “minimum standards” in terms of what is required; It should be noted that the existing standards should not be reviewed in isolation but collectively with all relevant standards to gain the full picture (e.g., IEC and ISO standards); Besides the below existing standards, other aspects (e.g., Data Quality assurance, availability and reliability of systems and signals) and as a result of development or increasing user needs (HCD), may be considered.
