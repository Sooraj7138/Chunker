ACCREDITATION AND APPROVAL OF VTS MODEL COURSES
The competent authorities need to ensure that training organisations are accredited and approved for each IALA VTS model course that they deliver.
This process involves two steps:

ACCREDITATION AND APPROVAL OF VTS MODEL COURSES

ACCREDITATION AND APPROVAL OF VTS MODEL COURSES

ACCREDITATION AND APPROVAL OF VTS MODEL COURSES
P 10

ACCREDITATION AND APPROVAL OF VTS MODEL COURSES

• Accreditation which is the formal endorsement that a training organization operates under a suitable quality management system to deliver effective training.
ACCREDITATION AND APPROVAL OF VTS MODEL COURSES

• Approval which is the formal endorsement that a training organization meets the standards specified in an IALA model course for its implementation, delivery and assessment.
ACCREDITATION AND APPROVAL OF VTS MODEL COURSES
IALA Guideline G1014 Accreditation of VTS Training Organizations and Approval to Deliver IALA VTS Model Courses [11] sets out the process by which a training organization can be accredited to deliver approved VTS training courses.
ACCREDITATION AND APPROVAL OF VTS MODEL COURSES
A list of training organizations accredited to deliver VTS model courses in accordance with IALA Guideline G1014 are available on the IALA website.
RECOGNITION OF PRIOR LEARNING
Exemptions from a module or subject elements within a VTS model course may be considered depending on the qualifications and training that an individual may already have.
The accredited training organization delivering the approved model course should assess the prior learning of a candidate.
RECOGNITION OF PRIOR LEARNING
IALA Guideline G1017 Assessment for Recognition of Prior Learning in VTS Training [5] provides further guidance on the assessment and recognition of prior learning.
6.8. USE OF SIMULATORS
Simulation training should be included in VTS training as part of the C0103 model courses and in the process of maintaining qualifications to:

6.8. USE OF SIMULATORS
verify to what extent the competence levels of VTS model courses have been met.
6.8. USE OF SIMULATORS

• assess performance as part of the process of maintaining qualification (skills and development training and revalidation training).
6.8. USE OF SIMULATORS
Simulation training enables the creation of simple and complex, high-risk situations within a VTS environment.
These situations replicate the interaction between VTS, ships, ports, allied services, and other organizations as appropriate, to manage and monitor ship traffic and respond to developing unsafe situations.
6.8. USE OF SIMULATORS
This training provides a structured and effective method for developing and maintaining competencies by replicating real-world scenarios in a controlled setting.
Specifically, it:

6.8. USE OF SIMULATORS

• allows VTS personnel to practice technical skills, refine their decision-making, and enhance operational competence without the risks associated with real VTS operations.
6.8. USE OF SIMULATORS
emphasizes teamwork, communication, and adaptability.
6.8. USE OF SIMULATORS

• allows VTS personnel to build confidence in undertaking both routine day-to-day tasks, as well responding to developing situations or emergencies.
6.8. USE OF SIMULATORS
IALA Guideline G1027 Simulation in VTS Training [12] provides guidance for training organizations and VTS providers on developing and conducting simulation in their VTS training.
