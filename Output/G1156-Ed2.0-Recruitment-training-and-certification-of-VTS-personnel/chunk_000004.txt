• assess performance as part of the process of maintaining qualification (skills and development training and revalidation training).
Simulation training enables the creation of simple and complex, high-risk situations within a VTS environment.
These situations replicate the interaction between VTS, ships, ports, allied services, and other organizations as appropriate, to manage and monitor ship traffic and respond to developing unsafe situations.
This training provides a structured and effective method for developing and maintaining competencies by replicating real-world scenarios in a controlled setting.
Specifically, it: 
• allows VTS personnel to practice technical skills, refine their decision-making, and enhance operational competence without the risks associated with real VTS operations.
emphasizes teamwork, communication, and adaptability.

• allows VTS personnel to build confidence in undertaking both routine day-to-day tasks, as well responding to developing situations or emergencies.
IALA Guideline G1027 Simulation in VTS Training [12] provides guidance for training organizations and VTS providers on developing and conducting simulation in their VTS training.
