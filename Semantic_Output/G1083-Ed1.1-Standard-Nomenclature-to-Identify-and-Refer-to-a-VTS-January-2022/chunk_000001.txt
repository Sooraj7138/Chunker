1. INTRODUCTION
There may be cases where a ship reporting system (implemented by a competent authority under the provisions of IMO Resolution A.851 (20) [1] also makes use of such name identifiers, therefore causing possible confusion to mariners.

2. PURPOSE
This document aims to provide guidance to promote consistent nomenclature amongst VTS around the world.

3. NOMENCLATURE TO IDENTIFY A VTS
The naming policy for a VTS should ensure consistency for mariners.
The name identifier should include two key elements, namely the geographical location of the VTS and its capability.

3. NOMENCLATURE TO IDENTIFY A VTS
Where a VTS has been implemented by a competent authority, it is recommended that the name identifier includes the prefix or suffix “VTS”.

3.1. SECTORS WITHIN A VTS AREA
Considerations include the possibility that confusion may arise to both the mariners and VTS operators from using a variety of identifiers within a limited area, but equally, a competent authority may decide that there is a need to identify each of the sectors within the VTS area separately.
3.2. ALLIED SERVICES
Allied services may be conducted from a VTS centre.
Any service that is not authorised as a VTS should not use the term “VTS” in its name identifier, e.g., “Location PILOTS”.
