practices, policies and procedures exercised by an authority to provide strategic direction, ensure objectives, manage risk and use resources responsibly and with accountability are monitored and evaluated on a routine basis.
This should include documentation relating to: 
• VTS Objectives – Procedures to monitor and assess that the objectives set for the VTS are met and regularly reported to management.
Aspects and considerations include: 
• Setting performance measures, including both positive (leading) and negative (lag) performance measures; Establishing a framework to regularly assess the performance measures; and Reporting to management.
Evaluation – Procedures to regularly carry out an evaluation to ensure that the VTS operational objectives have been met, and the problems identified and defined for implementing the VTS have been either alleviated or at least reduced to an acceptable level.
Aspects and considerations in undertaking the evaluation include: 
• 
• The need for the VTS, which may include monitoring and identifying changes that may have occurred since the VTS was implemented or when previous evaluation was made regarding the volume of traffic and degree of risk; An operational evaluation of the VTS; and An evaluation of the operational objectives and the list of problems requiring attention.

• Policies – Procedures for maintaining policies associated with VTS, such as qualifications and training, compliance and enforcement.
Please note Guideline G1131 Setting and Measuring VTS Objectives [10] provides further guidance for competent authorities and VTS Authorities for setting objectives for a VTS and achieving the obligations associated with SOLAS regulation V/12 (Vessel Traffic Services) [11] and IMO Resolution A.1158(32)[2].
4.2. EMERGENCY PROCEDURES A VTS provider should have documented contingency plans to ensure the safety of VTS personnel and for the continuity of operations in the event of an emergency.
The VTS provider should have plans to address events such as: System and equipment failure: Loss of external communications; Loss of internal communications; Loss of functionality of sensor equipment; and Loss of information management systems.
Internal emergencies, for example, fire and flood Forced evacuation of VTS centre Personnel medical emergencies Security incidents The following issues may be included in these plans: IALA Guideline G1141 Operational Procedures for Delivering VTS Edition 3.0 urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1141:ed3.0 P 9 
• Remedial action Callout procedures 
• Fall-back options 
• Media or allied services communications Recording of incident 
• Data safeguarding Post-emergency debriefing EXTERNAL VTS PROCEDURES A VTS provider should implement processes and procedures for all external activities related to the VTS, such as the interaction between VTS and: 
• Vessel traffic, including: 
• the provision of timely and relevant information on factors that may influence the vessel's movements and assist onboard decision making; 
• the monitoring and management of vessel traffic to ensure the safety and efficiency of vessel movements; responding to developing unsafe situations; and 
• communication and processing of mandatory reporting requirements from vessels and other information as deemed appropriate.

• Allied services.
A clear distinction should be made between routine and emergency activities as described below.
Recognizing that activities may vary between VTS these may be further adapted to suit local needs.
Similarly, the exchange of information should be standardized where possible.
5.1. ROUTINE PROCEDURES 5.1.1. VTS VOICE COMMUNICATION Processes and procedures should be established to ensure that: VHF Communication is timely, clear, concise and unambiguous, taking into consideration: IMO Resolution A.918(22) Standard Marine Communication Phrases [12]); IMO Resolution A.954(23) Proper use of VHF Channels at Sea [13]); 
• IALA Guideline G1132 VTS Voice Communications and Phraseology [14]; and IALA Guideline G1111-2 Producing Requirements for Voice Communications The VHF channels used and monitored are clearly communicated.
Voice communications in VTS areas are generally conducted using VHF channels allocated in ITU Radio Regulations Appendix 
18. The use of simplex channels will ensure that participating ships are able to monitor all VHF IALA Guideline G1141 Operational Procedures for Delivering VTS Edition 3.0 urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1141:ed3.0 P 10 communication in the VTS area.
When simplex channels are unavailable due to insufficient channels or interference, duplex channels may be used.
1 5.1.2. PRE-ARRIVAL INFORMATION Prior to arriving at the VTS area, a vessel may be required to provide information and notify of its intent to enter the VTS area.
The VTS provider should specify the format and timing of pre-arrival information, if possible, by non-verbal means, see section 5.1.14. This may, for example, include: 
• Route information 
• ETA Vessel Identity (Name, IMO number, Call Sign, MMSI) Vessel dimensions as relevant 
• Vessel draft 
• Air draft 
• Hazardous, dangerous or polluting goods details ISPS security level Information about any vessel defects or deficiencies 
• Other specified details Further, processes and procedures to support the arrival of vessels to the VTS area should be established.
These should include: communication requirements for participating ships; reporting requirements for pre-arrival information; non-compliance with reporting requirements; and information exchange with allied services 5.1.3. VESSELS ENTERING VTS
