This Guideline is intended to be descriptive – not prescriptive, and as such, the intent is to publish a general, goal- based guideline whereby over-arching objectives are defined, but freedom to innovate is left to both developers and users.
This document is not intended to provide guidance for navigational information portrayal on the ships as this is defined by other competent bodies, but rather takes both existing and currently under development ship portrayal standards and guidelines into consideration to guide shore-side system development used to convey Marine Aids to Navigation information.
2.1. CORE OBJECTIVES
The following is a non-exhaustive list of core objectives that are associated with the presentation and display (i.e., portrayal) of Marine Aids to Navigation related navigation information.
Objectives include:

2.1. CORE OBJECTIVES
facilitate safe and secure navigation of vessels with regards to hydrographic, meteorological and navigational information and risks;

2.1. CORE OBJECTIVES
facilitate vessel traffic observation and management from shore/coastal facilities, where appropriate;

2.1. CORE OBJECTIVES
facilitate communications, including data exchange, between ship to ship, ship to shore, shore to ship, shore to shore and other users;

2.1. CORE OBJECTIVES
provide opportunities for improving the efficiency of transport and logistics;

2.1. CORE OBJECTIVES
support the effective operation of contingency response and search and rescue services;

2.1. CORE OBJECTIVES

2.1. CORE OBJECTIVES
integrate and present information onboard and ashore through a human-machine interface which maximizes navigational safety benefits and minimizes any risks of confusion or misinterpretation on the part of the user;

2.1. CORE OBJECTIVES
integrate and present information onboard and ashore to assist in managing the workload of the users, while also motivating and engaging the user and supporting decision-making;

2.1. CORE OBJECTIVES

2.2. BASIC PREMISE AND CAVEATS
The basic, over-riding premise of this Guideline is that:

2.2. BASIC PREMISE AND CAVEATS
Shipborne and shore-based equipment, systems and services should portray Marine Aids to Navigation (AtoN) related information to all users (both onboard and ashore) in a consistent manner.
2.2. BASIC PREMISE AND CAVEATS
However, there are several caveats:

2.2. BASIC PREMISE AND CAVEATS
How information is portrayed onboard or ashore depends on the particular tasks, function, and needs of the user.
2.2. BASIC PREMISE AND CAVEATS
The current situation or task-at-hand can influence the amount of information necessary to make informed decisions.
2.2. BASIC PREMISE AND CAVEATS
The portrayal of information onboard ships or ashore does not necessarily have to be identical but should have like meaning.
2.2. BASIC PREMISE AND CAVEATS
Considering the similarity between ship-side and shore-based related strategies in terms of technical and equipment portrayal standards, the IMO prescriptive documents play an important role in setting the portrayal standards for shore-based navigation.
In particular, IMO Resolution MSC.466(101) The Performance Standards For The Presentation Of Navigation-Related Information On Shipborne Navigational Displays updated the performance standards for navigation-related information display in onboard navigation display on 14 June 
2019. This resolution, which addresses standards for the description of metadata (Part 4.0) and equipment (Part 5.0), has significant implications for the synchronization of standards for data and information portrayal.

3. GENERAL REFERENCES
IMO and IEC have adopted several standards (i.e., references) that provide general guidance related to presentation, display or portrayal of navigation-related information.
Based on the premise that “shipborne and shore-based equipment, systems, and services should portray navigation-related information to all users (both onboard and ashore) in a consistent manner”,1 much of this guidance is relevant to the presentation, display or portrayal of navigation related information at shore-based facilities as well (e.g., at a VTS centre or port authority).

3. GENERAL REFERENCES
The following sections provide a brief summary of the key contents of each standard.

3. GENERAL REFERENCES
IMO Resolution MSC.191 (79), Performance Standards for the presentation of navigation-related information on shipborne navigational display, 6 December 2004.


3. GENERAL REFERENCES
The purpose of this standard is to “harmonize the requirements for the presentation of navigation-related information on the bridge of a ship to ensure that all navigational displays adopt a consistent human machine interface philosophy and implementation.” Further, it supplements and, in case of conflict, takes priority over presentation requirements of the individual performance standards.
This standard also includes the consistent use of navigational terms, abbreviations, colours and symbols, as well as other presentation characteristics.
This standard also addresses the presentation of information related to specific navigational tasks by recognising user- selected presentations in addition to presentations required by the relevant individual performance standards.

3. GENERAL REFERENCES
This guideline was developed to facilitate a successful ergonomic design of the bridge and the equipment on the bridge in order to improve the reliability and efficiency of navigation.
The Guideline contains ergonomic requirements as well as a user-centred design for a functionally-oriented bridge layout to support watch-keeping personnel in their tasks.
While these guidelines were primarily intended for shipborne equipment, much of the guidance applies to shore-based workstations as well.

OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS
The primary factor that influences the portrayal of navigation information is the operational situation.
In turn, what information is required depends on the voyage requirements, situational needs, operational perspective (shipborne or shore-based), and levels of information.
4.1. VOYAGE REQUIREMENTS
The type or amount of navigation-related information that will be portrayed by shipborne or shore-based users falls into two main categories: strategic and tactical overviews.
4.1. VOYAGE REQUIREMENTS

4.1. VOYAGE REQUIREMENTS
P 6

4.1. VOYAGE REQUIREMENTS
Strategic overview is associated with maintaining overall situational awareness within the surrounding areas.
This can include both monitoring and active engagement.
4.1. VOYAGE REQUIREMENTS
Tactical overview involves more direct action and decision-support within the immediate or designated area.
4.2. SITUATIONAL NEEDS
“Current situation” includes the various phases of navigation during a voyage and can be related to the prevailing conditions.
Examples of different navigation phases include open-ocean, coastal, and approach.
Prevailing conditions can include, but are not limited to, traffic density, alerts, time of day ship movement, and meteorological and hydrological conditions.
4.2. SITUATIONAL NEEDS
Regardless of the current situation, the task-at-hand can be the determining factor in deciding what information is crucial in making informed decisions.
This includes time-critical information necessary for grounding avoidance, collision avoidance, or maintaining overall situational awareness.
Information based on a planning system may also be part of this process.
4.2. SITUATIONAL NEEDS
Special attention should be given to Maritime Safety Information and emergency warning systems regarding EPIRB, MOB devices, and other devices providing emergency alert functionality.
4.2. SITUATIONAL NEEDS
Also, communication capabilities such as VHF, AIS, Mobile AtoN, etc.
should be considered according to the situational needs.
4.2. SITUATIONAL NEEDS
General principles for the presentation of symbology on shore-based displays:

4.2. SITUATIONAL NEEDS
The international onboard symbology and chart standards should be used as much as possible.
4.2. SITUATIONAL NEEDS
Symbology already identified for existing onboard use should not normally be assigned a different meaning for shore-based purposes; however, these symbols may be adapted to suit specific requirements.
4.2. SITUATIONAL NEEDS
Any adaptations to symbology must not modify the agreed standard for data transfer.
4.2. SITUATIONAL NEEDS
The clarity of the presentation and operator workload should be carefully considered.
