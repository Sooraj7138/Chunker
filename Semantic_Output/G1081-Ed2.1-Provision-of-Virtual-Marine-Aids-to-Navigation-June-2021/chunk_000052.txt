Application Function Conditions Suggested Type Consideration Mode of Virtual AIS AtoN 
• Conditions could be sea state such as crashing waves and submerged reef, strong current, water depth, strong ice movement, poor holding Virtual AtoN can be ground, etc.
Marking of Shoals and Reefs, Fairway and its Limits.
effectively utilized where it is difficult to place or to maintain a physical AtoN due to meteorological, topographical or hydrographical conditions.
Isolated Danger Marks, Cardinal Marks and Lateral Marks 
• This implementation should be supported by a technical assessment study and avoid being driven by an economic aspect.

• For existing AtoN, this must be supported by several discrepancy reports showing the repeatability of the event.
Virtual AtoN can be effectively utilized in approaches to a harbour entrance where a ship changes its course and Safe Water Marks where it is difficult to install a physical AtoN.
A clear marking of the point on approach will serve for an orderly flow of ships at an entrance and improve safety and efficiency of shipping.
Virtual AtoN can be Marking of Fairways and Marking of the Limits of Safe Waters effectively utilized where navigation becomes difficult due to a thick fog, heavy rain, etc.
(This application can also be adapted as a temporary marking during limited visibility.) Lateral Marks & Safe Water Marks

Application Function Conditions Mode Virtual AtoN can be Permanent Marking Special Area (e.g., anchorage area, area to be avoided) effectively utilized where precaution or special caution required.
A clear marking of special areas will improve safety of navigation.
Virtual AtoN can be effectively utilized where it is difficult to deploy or maintain a physical AtoN due to vessel to vessel or vessel Permanent Marking of to AtoN interaction (collision Marking Fairway and hits).
Potential applications include unique shoal in centre channel for deep draft vessel, alongside a wharf, corner buoy in a steep curve, etc.
Virtual AtoN can be effectively utilized where it enhances vessel traffic flow Permanent Marking Marking of Fairway patterns.
Potential applications are to mark the centre of each traffic lane or the separation between two lanes of a TSS and other usual routes.
Virtual AtoN can be effectively utilized where there is a need to verify if a potential AIS position offset exists on shipborne Permanent Marking Marking of Fairway navigational displays through the use of schematic reference point patterns.
This is generally a need in confined waters where high accuracy and performance of Suggested Type of Virtual AIS AtoN Special Marks Lateral and Cardinal Marks Safe Water Marks & Lateral Marks.
Reference point used in conjunction with a Predicted Synthetic AIS AtoN associated with an existing fixed AtoN.
Consideration 
• This measure will be effective only for vessels obligated to carry AIS equipment 
• Existing AtoN with history of multiple hits and with no repositioning options are good candidates.

• Client engagement is necessary to validate ship movement pattern and the effectiveness of the solution.

• Economic reason should not be a sole consideration.

• This is not a substitute for a TSS zone as the implementation of these or the modification of it must be investigated first.

• The efficiency of vessel traffic flow patterns is the goal of this application.

• The addition of a good radar mark as one of the reference points improves the efficiency of the reference pattern for ship radar validation.

• Predefined accurate coordinates as well as distance and bearing between Virtual marks need to be used and made
