ASSESSMENT OF WRECKS AND OBSTRUCTIONS
When a new wreck or obstruction has been announced a formal assessment must be made on whether;

ASSESSMENT OF WRECKS AND OBSTRUCTIONS
a vessel and personnel need to be deployed to accurately survey or guard the wreck or obstruction; and

ASSESSMENT OF WRECKS AND OBSTRUCTIONS
an appropriate AtoN needs to be deployed.
ASSESSMENT OF WRECKS AND OBSTRUCTIONS
Before traffic data was available, this decision relied almost entirely on the expertise of the assessor with no supporting evidence to underpin the decision.
Information is, and has been available for many years regarding vessel trading routes which helped to inform the process, but this information was not able to provide quantitative data on specific traffic movements or indeed an assessment of the dimension of vessels actually passing over a particular location.
ASSESSMENT OF WRECKS AND OBSTRUCTIONS
Considering each situation, those assessing the risk must make a rapid but informed decision based on the worst possible scenario.
An assessment of the clearance between the wreck and the sea surface at chart datum or Lowest Astronomical Tide (LAT) must be made.
ASSESSMENT OF WRECKS AND OBSTRUCTIONS
Using an appropriate analysis tool, and compiling AIS traffic data over a significant period, the assessor will be able to extract the volume and type of vessels over a specific draft that passes in the vicinity of the wreck.
ASSESSMENT OF WRECKS AND OBSTRUCTIONS
As an example, referring to Figure 1:

ASSESSMENT OF WRECKS AND OBSTRUCTIONS
If it is considered that an obstruction has been reported with a maximum height above the seabed of 15 metres, which is located in an area with surrounding depths of 22 metres, then the available depth over the obstruction is 7 metres and therefore, vessels with a draught over 5 metres maybe considered to be in danger.

Further filtering of vessels types, including the consideration of AIS class A and B will also provide for a more in depth assessment of the risk and mitigation measures required.

4.3. ASSESSMENT OF MARKING REQUIREMENTS FOR NEW OR EXISTING SHOALS AND SHALLOW AREAS SUBSEQUENT TO HYDROGRAPHIC SURVEY

ASSESSMENT OF WRECKS AND OBSTRUCTIONS
When new survey information is received it is necessary to make an assessment as to whether both charting and AtoN requirements needs to be amended.
This may have relevance to the AtoN already deployed.
A decision shall be made on whether new or amended AtoN are required and the time frame within which they must be deployed.
ASSESSMENT OF WRECKS AND OBSTRUCTIONS
When new survey information is received the GIS can be used to overlay survey and contour information from both the recent survey and historical data available.
The rate of change and consideration of AtoN in the area can then be clearly examined to make an informed assessment of any changes that may be required.
For example, the number, type, and draught of vessels, will have an impact on the decision for amending the current location of the AtoN or deployment of new AtoN.

By considering the actual coverage of current AtoN provided, including accurate assessment of nominal ranges of both charted and uncharted sectors of fixed lights, together with floating AtoN, then, combining this data with up to date traffic patterns an informed decision on the on-going requirements for existing AtoN and the requirement for additional or different AtoN can be made.

An on-going assessment will always be required to ensure that any changes, including bathymetry and new offshore dangers are addressed to ensure the continued safety of the mariner.

From figure 10 and figure 11 it can be seen that initial overlays of extensive traffic data require careful filtering for example on period, type of vessel and draughts to make a more informed assessment of requirements.

AIS data and other traffic information can assist in determining whether a new routing measure or separation scheme is required.
The responsible authority, by analysing the AIS data for a specific area of interest, can determine the routes used by different types of vessels.
