be required in three generic circumstances: 
• When observed 
• On request 
• Procedural 4.3.1. WHEN OBSERVED This is a situation when the VTS observes a developing navigational situation (e.g., a ship deviating from a planned or recommended route) and deems it necessary to intervene.
Early intervention is likely to be necessary, which may preclude pre-assessment checks being carried out.
Once the immediate situation has been resolved, the continuation of navigational support should be subsequently clarified and the need for further assessments and checks considered.
4.3.2. ON REQUEST This is a situation when navigational support is provided at the request of a member of a ship’s bridge team or an embarked pilot.
Provision of navigational support should be formalized and there should be sufficient time for the VTS to make appropriate pre-assessment checks.
4.3.3. PROCEDURAL This is a situation when navigational support from a VTS forms part of a specific local operational procedure agreed to between participants.
All participants should be appropriately trained in such procedures, which should be formally documented and promulgated.
4.3.4. EXAMPLES OF RESPONDING TO DEVELOPING UNSAFE SITUATIONS Examples of navigational support when responding to developing unsafe situations include those shown in Table 3: Table 3 Examples of navigational support when responding to unsafe situations Information related to: Examples: 
• Requesting ship identification and details such as position, course Request and identification and speed.

• Requesting status of ship's equipment.

• Identifying start and end of navigational support if time permits.

• Providing range and bearing from fixed objects, fairway/channel or Navigational way-points.
information 
• Providing proximity to navigational hazards.
(including position and course information) 
• Providing information related to navigating into a channel/fairway/lane (i.e., track is parallel/diverging/converging with/from/to reference line).

• Advising a ship to alter the course, speed.
Advice 
• Advising a ship to close up/drop back on/from another ship 
• Advising a ship to keep clear from area/position.
IALA Guideline G1089 Provision of a VTS Edition 2.0 urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1089:ed2.0 ) P 10 Information related to: Examples: 
• Deviating from the planned or recommended route towards shallow water, dangerous wrecks or other obstacles not otherwise Warning promulgated.

• Diving operations.

• Ships not under command.

• Instructing a ship to keep clear from area/position.
Note: The VTS provider should give careful consideration to the Instruction authorization of VTS personnel for issuing an Instruction in developing unsafe situations.

5. VTS BEYOND TERRITORIAL SEAS SOLAS regulation V/12 (Vessel Traffic Services) paragraph 3, specifically states that: “The use of VTS may only be made mandatory in sea areas within the territorial seas of a coastal state.” Recognizing the contribution of VTS to the safety of navigation, improved efficiency of traffic flow and the protection of the marine environment, a VTS may be established beyond territorial seas either: in association with an IMO adopted system; or 
• on the basis of voluntary participation.
5.1. VTS IN ASSOCIATION WITH AN IMO ADOPTED SYSTEM IMO Resolution A.1158(32) Guidelines for Vessel Traffic Services states that: “A VTS may be established in association with an IMO adopted ships' routeing system or mandatory ship reporting system in accordance with regulations V/10 and V/11 of the Convention, respectively.” The principles of the provision of VTS to participating ships set out in paragraphs 4.1 – 4.3 still apply, but consideration may need to be given to the legal basis for any powers of regulation and enforcement.
5.2. VTS ON THE BASIS OF VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION IMO Resolution A.1158(32) Guidelines for Vessel Traffic Services states that: “A VTS may also be established beyond the territorial seas of a coastal State to provide information and advice on the basis of voluntary participation.” When a VTS is established beyond the territorial seas of a coastal State solely on the basis of voluntary participation, it is unlikely that it will have any powers of regulation or enforcement.
While the principles of the provision of VTS set out in paragraphs 4.1 – 4.3 above still apply, a VTS established on the basis of voluntary participation is unlikely to be empowered to regulate or issue instructions.
VTS personnel should take into account that where a VTS is established on the basis of voluntary participation, not all ships present in the VTS Area may be participating and may not even be monitoring the designated communications channel(s).

6. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS IMO Resolution A.1158(32) Guidelines for Vessel Traffic Services states that: IALA Guideline G1089 Provision of a VTS Edition 2.0 urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1089:ed2.0 P 11 “Ships not designated as participating ships may take part in a VTS subject to complying with the requirements of the VTS and any guidance issued by the VTS provider”.
Instances where this may occur include situations when: 
• a VTS may encourage voluntary participation from categories of ships that are not required by the regulations of that VTS to participate; or 
• a ship
