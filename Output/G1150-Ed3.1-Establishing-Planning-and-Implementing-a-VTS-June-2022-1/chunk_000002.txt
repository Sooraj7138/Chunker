into account “when planning, implementing and operating vessel traffic services (VTS) under national law”.
In particular, it describes the responsibilities for: Contracting Governments to: “establish a legal basis for VTS that gives effect to regulation V/12 of the Convention; and appoint and authorize a competent authority for VTS.” Competent authorities to: 
• “establish a regulatory framework for establishing and operating VTS in accordance with relevant international conventions and IMO instruments, IALA standards and national law; authorize a VTS provider to operate a VTS within a delineated VTS area; ensure that VTS training is approved and VTS personnel are certified; and 
• establish a compliance and enforcement framework with respect to violations of VTS regulatory requirements.” 4.3. IALA STANDARDS To achieve world-wide harmonization and improvement of VTS, IALA has developed a document structure to be used in order to develop and publish documents specifically related to the development, implementation, and operation of VTS.
The principal components to the IALA document structure include: 
• Standards Recommendations 
• Guidelines 
• Model courses IALA standards are not mandatory; if an organization wishes to claim compliance with an IALA standard however, then it should implement the normative recommendations referenced in the Standard.
IALA standards relating to VTS include: IALA Guideline G1150 Establishing, Planning and Implementing a VTS Edition 3.1 urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1150:ed3.1 @ P 6 S1040 - Vessel Traffic Services S1010 - AtoN Planning and Service Requirements [6] S1050 - Training and Certification [7] S1070 – Information Services [8] 4.3.1. RECOMMENDATIONS IALA recommendations specify what practices shall be carried out in order to comply with a recommendation, and may be referenced, in full or in part, in an IALA standard.
Recommendations may be referenced as normative or informative, where: 
• normative provisions are those with which it is necessary to conform to claim compliance to the standard; and 
• informative provisions are those which specify additional desirable practices but with which it is not necessary to conform to claim compliance to the standard.
4.3.2. GUIDELINES IALA guidelines describe how to implement practices normally specified in a recommendation.
These documents provide detailed, in depth information on an aspect of a specific subject, indicating options, best practices and suggestions for implementation.
IALA guidelines relate to planning, operating, and managing marine aids to navigation.
4.3.3. MODEL COURSES IALA model courses are training documents which define the level of training and knowledge needed to reach levels of competence defined by IALA.
Model courses for VTS include training programmes on the specific knowledge and skill requirements necessary for the qualification of VTS personnel.
IALA DOCUMENTATION RELATING TO VTS - A reference list of the standards, recommendations, guidelines and model courses specifically related to the implementation and operation of a VTS is available on the IALA website.
4.4. NATIONAL LAW Key responsibilities of Contracting Governments and competent authorities in planning and establishing a VTS described in IMO Resolution A.1158(32) include: 
• Ensuring that a legal basis for the operation of a VTS is provided for and that the VTS is operated in accordance with national and international law.
Ensuring that a VTS provider is appointed and legally empowered.
Instructing the VTS provider to operate the VTS in accordance with relevant IMO resolutions.

• Establishing a policy with respect to violations of VTS regulatory requirements and ensure that this policy is consistent with national law.
Note: It is recognized that where a legal basis for a VTS has not been established in national law it may take some time for this to be established.
In such situations consideration could be given to proceeding with section 5 (Planning and Implementing) as described below to determine whether or not a VTS is the appropriate mechanism to improve the safety and efficiency of navigation, safety of life at sea and the protection of the marine environment for a particular waterway.
IALA Guideline G1150 Establishing, Planning and Implementing a VTS Edition 3.1 urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1150:ed3.1 P 7 PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTING The implementation and operation of a VTS to improve the safety and efficiency of navigation, safety of life at sea and the protection of the marine environment is a significant investment.
Careful planning should be undertaken to ensure a VTS is implemented effectively, achieves its objectives and is sufficiently resourced and funded on an ongoing basis.
When planning and implementing a VTS, a project management approach is recommended to ensure the major deliverables, assumptions and constraints are clearly documented.
This will assist in defining the scope of the VTS, its goals and objectives that need to be met.
Project management is considered as a discipline with the purpose to achieve specific goals and objectives by planning, organizing, motivating, and controlling resources.

• Relevant international guidance prepared and published by appropriate international organizations regarding project management should be considered, or where there are national requirements for project management, these should be
