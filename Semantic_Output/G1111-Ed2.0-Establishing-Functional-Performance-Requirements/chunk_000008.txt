1. INTRODUCTION
This Guideline is associated with Recommendation R0128 VTS Systems and Equipment [1], a normative provision of IALA Standard S1040 Vessel Traffic Services (VTS).
To demonstrate compliance with the Recommendation, the provisions of this Guideline should be taken into account.
1.1. PURPOSE
This Guideline is one of the G1111 series of guideline documents.
The purpose of the G1111 series is to assist the competent authority for VTS and the VTS provider in preparing the definition, specification, establishment, technical operation and upgrades of a VTS system.
The documents address the relationship between the functional requirements and VTS system performance (technical) requirements and how these reflect into system design and sub system requirements.
1.2. G1111 GUIDELINE SERIES
The G1111 series of guideline documents present system design, sensors, communications, processing, and acceptance, without inferring priority.
New sub-guidelines can be introduced to the G1111 series in future.
The guideline documents are numbered and titled as follows:

1.2. G1111 GUIDELINE SERIES

• G1111 Establishing Functional and Performance Requirements for VTS Systems and Equipment

1.2. G1111 GUIDELINE SERIES

• G1111-1 Producing Requirements for the Core VTS System

2. ESTABLISHING THE FUNCTIONAL AND PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR A VTS SYSTEM AND EQUIPMENT
IALA Guideline G1150 Establishing, Planning and Implementing VTS [2] advises on the planning and implementation of a VTS related to the definition of operational, functional, performance and acceptance requirements of a VTS system.
These requirements should be:

derived from a business case and feasibility study in the initiating phase; and

defined in the planning phase of the overall VTS project before the procurement of the VTS system.

2. ESTABLISHING THE FUNCTIONAL AND PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR A VTS SYSTEM AND EQUIPMENT
The competent authority for VTS and/or the VTS provider should establish operational, functional and performance requirements and acceptance plan for a VTS system at the same time as they establish their procurement plan.
These requirements should form the basis for the entire system lifecycle, its definition and its acceptance following implementation.

2. ESTABLISHING THE FUNCTIONAL AND PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR A VTS SYSTEM AND EQUIPMENT
The G1111 Guideline Series provide generic guidance for all potential equipment and sensors that may be used in designing a VTS system.
The guidance is not prescriptive, and the capabilities required may vary between VTS, VTS area and VTS sectors or even specific parts of a VTS area or sector.
VTS capability should be linked to a risk assessment which will identify the degree of mitigation expected of a VTS, together with other mitigation measures, in addressing a specific hazard or hazards.
The extent of risk mitigation will be determined by a number of factors that include the equipment fit, equipment capability, local geography and operator authorization/training.
This Guideline focuses on an overview of the key areas for consideration related to the establishment of a VTS system.

2. ESTABLISHING THE FUNCTIONAL AND PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR A VTS SYSTEM AND EQUIPMENT
IALA sub-guidelines G1111-1 to G1111-8 provide specific guidance on initiating and planning functional and performance requirements and implementing VTS systems and equipment, based on operational requirements.

2. ESTABLISHING THE FUNCTIONAL AND PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR A VTS SYSTEM AND EQUIPMENT
Acceptance steps are typically conducted on the proposed or implemented VTS to ensure compliance with the requirements.
These acceptance steps are discussed in G1111-9 Framework for Acceptance of VTS Systems and Equipment.
2.1. PROJECT PLANNING
IALA Guideline G1150 recommends a project management approach to ensure that major deliverables, assumptions and constraints are clearly documented when planning and implementing a VTS.
This will assist in defining the scope of the VTS, its goals and objectives that need to be met.
Project management is considered as a discipline with the purpose to achieve specific goals and objectives by planning, organizing, motivating, and controlling resources.
2.1. PROJECT PLANNING
Relevant international guidance prepared and published by appropriate international organizations regarding project management should be considered, or, where there are national requirements for project management, these should be used.
PROJECT MANAGEMENT STEPS 2.1.1.
Project management is undertaken in different steps in order to improve control and quality.
Guideline G1150 provides an overview of the five project management phases and the key areas for consideration as they relate to

It is noted that before completing each stage to define functional and performance requirements, these results could be re-evaluated by risk assessment and cost benefit analysis.
The core practice in the planning phase is finalising the requirements.
This involves combining the relevant operational requirements with the functional and performance requirements, without unintentionally restricting flexibility in the implementation.
PROJECT MANAGEMENT STEPS 2.1.1.
It is important to write well-structured, individual requirement statements within the published requirements documentation.

Note that, for the implementation phase, several possible technical solutions may be identified to achieve the defined requirements and each of these solutions may have different strengths and weaknesses.
