traffic and protection of the environment Operational considerations Compliance and Enforcement The competent authority for VTS should establish a compliance and enforcement framework with respect to violations of VTS regulatory requirements (Refer A.1158(32) 5.2.4) The VTS provider should “[Ensure] compliance with and enforcement of regulatory provisions for which they are empowered” (Refer G1089 4.2) IALA Standards Contracting Governments are encouraged to take into account IALA standards and associated recommendations, guidelines and model courses (Refer A.XXX(XX) Section 9) Ensuring that vessels which are not complying with VTS regulatory requirements are notified that they are breaking national law by means of formal process.
Demonstrate ongoing compliance with IALA Standards related to VTS, including: 
• 1040 ‐ Vessel Traffic Services; 
• 1010 ‐ AtoN Planning and Service Requirements; 
• 1050 ‐ Training and Certification; and 
• 1070 – Information Services.

• 100% violation actions taken and notifications issued to the contravening party.

• Regular internal and external audits confirm compliance.
IALA Guideline 1131 Setting and Measuring VTS Objectives Edition 1.1 urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1131:ed1.1 P 11 Qualifications and Training VTS personnel should only be considered competent when appropriately trained and qualified for their VTS duties.
This includes: .1 satisfactorily completing generic VTS training approved by a competent authority; .2 satisfactorily completing on‐the‐job training at the VTS where the personnel are employed; .3 undergoing periodic assessments and revalidation training to ensure competence is maintained; and .4 being in possession of appropriate certification.
(Refer A.XXX(XX) Section 8) Quality Management All staff are subject to Quality Management System (QMS) (Refer IALA Recommendation R0132 Quality Management for Aids to Navigation Authority) Establish training policy and procedures for VTS personnel (e.g., number of days, quality of course, etc.) to meet Recommendation R0103. To establish and maintain a formal QMS.

• 100% VTSOs trained to the minimum of V‐103/1 and V‐103/3 
• Recurrent training of VTS personnel completed every 3 years.

• Annual regular assessments of
