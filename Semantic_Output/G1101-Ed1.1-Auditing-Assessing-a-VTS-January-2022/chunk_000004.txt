The establishment and on-going operation of a VTS is a considerable investment.
To achieve the purposes for which it was implemented, it needs to be effective and routinely evaluated to ensure that the operational objectives are being met, the technical and operational performance is acceptable, and the issues identified and defined in determining the need for the VTS have been either alleviated or at least reduced to an acceptable level.
