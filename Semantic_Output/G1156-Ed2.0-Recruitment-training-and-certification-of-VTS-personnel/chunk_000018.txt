8.2 - VTS personnel should only be considered competent when appropriately trained and qualified for their VTS duties, and,


9. MAINTAINING QUALIFICATIONS
8.2.3 undergoing periodic assessments and revalidation training to ensure competence is maintained.

9. MAINTAINING QUALIFICATIONS
In this context, “revalidation” refers to the process required to maintain a VTS qualification.

9. MAINTAINING QUALIFICATIONS
A structured process for revalidation and continued professional development ensures that holders of VTS qualifications maintain and develop skills, improve their competency, and prevents skills and knowledge from degrading over time.

9. MAINTAINING QUALIFICATIONS
To ensure qualifications remain current VTS personnel should participate in required training, stay informed about new procedures, refresh knowledge, and demonstrate ongoing competency.

9. MAINTAINING QUALIFICATIONS
VTS providers should establish processes and procedures for maintaining qualifications and continual professional development to ensure VTS personnel remain qualified to conduct their VTS duties taking into account of any additional requirements identified by the Competent Authority.

9. MAINTAINING QUALIFICATIONS
Consideration should be given to the following areas:


9. MAINTAINING QUALIFICATIONS

• Periodic assessments to verify competence and address cases where personnel fall below required competency levels.

9. MAINTAINING QUALIFICATIONS

• A training strategy to continue the development of skills.

9. MAINTAINING QUALIFICATIONS

• A training strategy to cope with changes in the VTS environment, including regulatory, operational and technical (adaptation training).

9. MAINTAINING QUALIFICATIONS

• Revalidation training within the time frame as determined by the competent authority.

9. MAINTAINING QUALIFICATIONS

• Procedures for personnel returning after a break in service.

9. MAINTAINING QUALIFICATIONS

• Maintenance of additional qualifications where VTS personnel hold VTS supervisor or OJT Instructor certificates.

9. MAINTAINING QUALIFICATIONS
The process for maintaining qualifications should address the VTS duties carried out by VTS personnel.
This includes initial VTS training (C0103-1 VTS Operator and C0103-3 VTS OJT) as well as role specific training (C0103-2 VTS Supervisor and C0103-4 VTS OJT Instructor).
The process for maintaining qualifications may vary depending on the requirements of the competent authority, the operational requirements of the VTS provider, and the individual’s training needs.
This includes an approach including periodic assessments as well as specific revalidation training.
The training activities to maintain qualifications are presented in figure 1.
