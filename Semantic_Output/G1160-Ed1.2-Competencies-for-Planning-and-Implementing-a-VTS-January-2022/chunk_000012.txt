4. ESTABLISHING
Competencies within the international framework for establishing a VTS


4. ESTABLISHING
Topic Element The administration’s policies relating to VTS.
Key considerations include establishing policy frameworks for: 
• Training and Certification; 
• Compliance and Enforcement; 
• Authorising VTS providers; Governance 
• Auditing a VTS.
A proper quality assurance system should be implemented to ensure policies issued by the competent authority for VTS are adhered to by the VTS provider and the approved VTS training organization; and 
• An ongoing evaluation of the VTS, in terms of meeting its objectives and addressing the reasons for which it was implemented.

5. PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTING
The implementation of a VTS to improve the safety and efficiency of navigation, safety of life at sea and the protection of the marine environment, and its ongoing operation, is a significant investment.
Careful planning should be undertaken to ensure a VTS is implemented effectively, achieves its objectives and is sufficiently resourced and funded on an ongoing basis.

5. PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTING
IALA Guideline G1150 Establishing, Planning and Implementing VTS recommends that, when planning and implementing VTS, a project management approach be adopted to ensure the major deliverables, assumptions and constraints are clearly documented.
In particular, the Guideline states that:


5. PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTING
“Relevant international guidance prepared and published by appropriate international organizations regarding project management should be considered, or where there are national requirements for project management, these should be used.”


5. PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTING
As an example of international guidance, the Guideline refers to ISO 21500 Guidance on Project Management [13] - an international standard issued by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

5. PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTING
IALA Guideline G1150 highlights the five project management phases and the key areas for consideration as they


5. PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTING
relate to VTS:


5. PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTING

1. Initiating - This marks the beginning of the project.
The goal of this phase is to define the proposed implementation of a VTS at a broad level and its feasibility to address the issues and problems associated with the volume of traffic and degree of risk in the waterway.

5. PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTING

2. Planning - During this phase, the scope and goals of the project are defined and a project management plan is developed.
It involves identifying the cost, quality, available resources and a realistic timetable.

5. PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTING
Implementing - This is the phase where deliverables are developed and completed.

5. PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTING

4. Controlling - This phase is invariable carried out simultaneously with Phase 3 (Implementing), thereby ensuring that project objectives and deliverables are met.
This phase is about measuring project progression and performance and ensuring that everything happening aligns with the project management plan.
