CATEGORIES OF INFORMATION
Three different categories of navigational information, both at the present time and likely in the future, could be considered.
While these categorizations are focused on ship-based information and not related to shore-based portrayal, the knowledge of these potential categories may be considered useful when aligning portrayals on shore with those on ship:2

CATEGORIES OF INFORMATION
1 Required by IMO – Information on systems required onboard ships mainly through SOLAS Chapter IV and SOLAS Chapter V.
CATEGORIES OF INFORMATION
2 Required by Flag or Port States in national waters – Additional information may be required by individual Flag or Port States due to individual conditions in those areas or regions.
