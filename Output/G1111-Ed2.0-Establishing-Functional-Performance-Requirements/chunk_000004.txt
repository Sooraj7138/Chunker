3.3. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS 3.3.1. The VTS provider should specify the local environmental conditions for VTS system performance, design and outdoor installations.
EQUIPMENT SHELTERS 3.3.2. A shelter can provide a protective environment with characteristics that depend on the location and design of the shelter.
In situations where contained equipment is reliant on the environment created by the shelter, the shelter facilities (e.g., cooling or heating) may become critical to the achieved availability of the equipment.
LIGHTNING PROTECTION 3.3.3. Lightning protection is often subject to national or local legislation taking into account local conditions, severity, earth conductivity, power grid constraints etc.
The guidance from country to country differs depending on lightning strike frequency and severity.
As a consequence, requirements for the number and type of lightning arrestors, the number of earthing points and the minimum cross sectional area of conductors vary to suit local conditions.
The general principles include: IALA Guideline G1111 Establishing Functional and Performance Requirements for VTS Systems and Equipment Edition 2.0 urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1111:ed2.0 P 10 ® 
• Lightning arrestors and/or conductors should be positioned higher than other equipment and be designed to protect the entire installation.
Separate down conductor(s) on the exterior of buildings should not be connected to metal parts of buildings such as steel reinforcements, handrails and antenna masts.

• Safety grounding of equipment should be kept separate from lightning protection.

• Potential equalization should be achieved in earth and never at the top of the equipment.
See Guideline G1012 The Protection of Lighthouses and Other Aids to Navigation against Damage from Lightning for further information.

• Warning lights.
High structures, such as RADAR towers, may require warning lights for air traffic.
Some light arrangements may also be disturbing to both vessel traffic, the general public and to birds and animals.
It is therefore recommended to consult local authorities for specific requirements or restrictions in the area.
SITE AND EQUIPMENT ACCESS 3.3.4. As part of the selection of a VTS system location, the VTS provider should analyse the need for site access for installation and maintenance.
Fencing and other protective means against illegal intrusion may also be needed in many cases.
ELECTRICAL POWER 3.3.5. The VTS system could require a reliable source of electrical power, which could include a backup power source such as an Uninterruptable Power Supply (UPS) and/or generator.
Renewable sources should be used where appropriate.
SAFETY AND SECURITY PRECAUTIONS 3.3.6. For each location, the VTS provider should implement safety and security requirements in accordance with relevant legislation.
Safety requirements should, at least, consider but are not limited to: safety procedures, such as instructions to personnel performing maintenance; personnel protection equipment for working at heights; 
• lone working on remote sites; safety switches to isolate equipment and to stop rotating antennas; 
• precautions regarding electromagnetic radiation, rotating machinery and electrical shock, railings on masts etc.; and 
• protection of the general public.
Security requirements should, at least, consider: physical restrictions, e.g., fences, locks, motion sensors, monitoring (CCTV); and access procedures, i.e., restrictions imposed by ISPS.
EQUIPMENT PRESERVATION AND MONITORING 3.3.7. The VTS provider should also consider the following: fire detection and (remote) alarms; 
• automated fire extinguishers; IALA Guideline G1111 Establishing Functional and Performance Requirements for VTS Systems and Equipment Edition 2.0 urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1111:ed2.0 P 11 4) remote monitoring of site status (power, fuel, temperature, site environmental conditions etc.); and 
• remote monitoring of equipment status.
MARKING AND IDENTIFICATION 3.3.8. VTS equipment should be marked with manufacturer name, type and serial number.
Legislation may require additional marking or identification, signposts etc.
DOCUMENTATION 3.3.9. The VTS provider should specify deliverable documentation to accompany the VTS equipment, which should be available for appropriate personnel.
As a minimum, documentation should include: 
• operating instructions; 
• maintenance instructions (preventive and corrective) inclusive of procedures and spare parts catalogue; safety information (e.g., regarding radiation, electrical safety and rotating machinery); certificates and permissions as required by relevant legislation; 
• test procedures, test certificates; and “As built” documentation comprising drawings, equipment configurations, software versions, etc.
EQUIPMENT STANDARDS AND APPROVALS 3.3.10. Legal requirements for equipment standards and approval (or statements of conformity) vary from country to country.
It is the responsibility of the VTS provider to ensure compliance to local, regional and international standards.
The VTS Provider should state any applicable standards as part of the acquisition process.
VTS providers should ensure that all appropriate standards and approvals for their VTS area have been considered.
Typical standards and approvals may include the following: 
• Electrical Safety 
• Mechanical Safety 
• Radiation Safety Electromagnetic Compatibility Radio Spectrum licensing 
• Hazardous / Chemical Substances 
4. DEFINITIONS The following definitions apply within this document and in all the G1111 series of guideline documents: the VTS system is the VTS software, hardware, communications and sensors.
