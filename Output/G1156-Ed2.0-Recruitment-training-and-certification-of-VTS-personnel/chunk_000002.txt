manager is responsible for managing and coordinating the activities of the VTS centre on behalf of the VTS provider.
In some cases, a VTS manager may have the responsibility for more than one VTS centre.
It is recognised that the manager may or may not be trained in VTS operations and appropriately qualified to perform the duties of VTS personnel as described in 8.2 of IMO Resolution A.1158(32).
The VTS manager should be familiar with operations in the VTS area, the tasks performed by the VTS personnel, and interactions with allied services and other stakeholders.

SELECTION AND RECRUITMENT 5.1. SELECTION PROCESS Policies and processes for the selection and recruitment of VTS personnel should be available.
This may include minimum entry requirements such as: 
• prior skills and knowledge; 
• maritime experience and education; 
• personal suitability characteristics; and 
• medical fitness requirements.
IMO Resolution A.918(22) [4] on the IMO standard marine communication phrases recognises the wide use of the English language for international navigational communications and that where language difficulties arise, English should be used as a common language for navigational purposes.
Potential candidates should demonstrate using reliable tests they have attained a sufficient level of the language.
Every candidate attending a C0103 model course should have achieved the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) level 5, or its equivalent.
The selection process should provide a mechanism for VTS providers to assesses the suitability of candidates to perform the required VTS tasks.
The selection process may include assessing personal attributes, aptitude testing, assessment of prior learning and satisfying the medical/physical requirements.
5.1.1. PERSONAL ATTRIBUTES Personal attributes are an important component of the selection process, and the following elements should be assessed when determining the suitability of a candidate: 
• Personality as a prediction of future workplace behaviour IALA Guideline G1156 Recruitment, Training and Certification of VTS Personnel Edition 2.0 urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1156:ed2.0 P 7 o Behaviour, where candidates should demonstrate a strong sense of responsibility, the ability to work independently, and a willingness to collaborate effectively as part of a team 5.1.2.

Different types of tests and evaluations may be used such as: 
• interviews 
• written tests 
• practical tests or exercises 
• psychometric tests Assessments should be designed to evaluate the suitability of a candidate within a VTS environment by: 
• distinguishing among relevant and irrelevant information (e.g., assess the relative movement of fixed and moving objects); combining auditory and visual information; 
• demonstrating spatial and situational awareness; 
• demonstrating alertness and decisiveness when required; carrying out several tasks simultaneously (multi-tasking); carrying out routine work without losing situational awareness; 
• prioritising and deciding what situations require immediate action; 
• show initiative and make decisions whilst working within a framework of standards, regulations and structured procedures; 
• working under conditions of stress; 
• demonstrating effective participation as a member of a team; 
• demonstrating appropriate communication, literacy (written and oral) and numeracy skills.
To assess the aptitude, attributes and suitability of a candidate, the assistance of specialists may be required to ensure appropriate tests and exercises are in place to complement the interview process conducted by the VTS provider.
5.1.3. MEDICAL/PHYSICAL REQUIREMENTS The VTS provider should establish policies on medical and physical requirements which candidates and VTS personnel need to meet such as medical, hearing and vision requirements.
5.2. SHIFTWORK Candidates may vary in how they cope with shift work depending on their health, fitness, age, lifestyle, and domestic responsibilities.
In the recruitment process, a candidate should be provided with information about the VTS shift work arrangements and procedures.
Further, if they are successful, it may be possible to offer work experience to allow the candidate to make an informed decision to whether shift work is suitable for them.
