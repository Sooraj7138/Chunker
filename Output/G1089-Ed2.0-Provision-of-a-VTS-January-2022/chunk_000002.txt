development of unsafe situations through: 1. providing timely and relevant information on factors that may influence ship movements and assist on-board decision making.
2. monitoring and managing ship traffic to ensure the safety and efficiency of ship movements.
3. responding to developing unsafe situations.” 4.1. TIMELY AND RELEVANT INFORMATION The provision of timely and relevant information on factors that may influence the ship's movements and assist on-board decision making should be provided where: deemed necessary by the VTS; or 
• requested by the participating ship.
Timely and relevant information may include but is not limited to: The position, identity, intention, and movements of ships.

• Maritime Safety Information (MSI) such as meteorological and hydrological conditions, notices to mariners, status of marine aids to navigation.
Scheduling information to enable a ship to optimize its overall passage efficiency.

• 
• Limitations of ships in the VTS area that may impose restrictions on the navigation of other ships (e.g., manoeuvrability), or any other potential hindrances.
Information concerning the safe navigation of the ship.

• Other information such as: Reporting formalities and International Ship and Port Facility Security Code details.
Information to and from allied services.

• Amendments and changes in promulgated information concerning the VTS area such as boundaries, procedures, radio frequencies, reporting points.
4.1.1. DELIVERY OF INFORMATION Depending on the type of information and the situation, this may be delivered by: 
• Broadcasting the information at fixed times and intervals, as promulgated in the appropriate navigational publications.
Communicating directly with individual ship(s).

• Data exchange and automated reporting as appropriate and where these are available.
4.1.2. EXAMPLES OF TIMELY AND RELEVANT INFORMATION Examples of timely and relevant information include those shown in Table 1: Table 1 Examples of timely and relevant information Information related to: Examples: 
• Position, identity, destination of ships and the intention of other traffic.

• Amendments and changes in promulgated information concerning Navigational situations (including traffic and route information) 
• 
• the VTS area such as boundaries, procedures, radio frequencies, reporting points.
The mandatory reporting of movements.
Limited manoeuvrability that may impose restrictions on the navigation of other ships, or any other potential hindrances.

• Suspension or change of routes.

• Uncharted obstacles such as dangerous wrecks.
Navigational warnings 
• Diving operations.

• Ships not under command.

• Wind speed and direction.

• Direction and height of the wave.
Meteorology 
• Visibility.

• Atmospheric pressure.

• Formation of ice.

• Gale.

• Storm.
Meteorological warnings 
• Tsunami.

• Restricted visibility.

• Stability of the seabed.
Hydrography 
• 
• The accuracy of surveys.
Tidal height.

• Tidal streams.
Electronic navigational 
• The availability of electronic navigational aids such as: GNSS, DGNSS, aids eLoran, AIS, LRIT, RACON.

• Port information.

• Pilot or tug request.

• Cargo information.
Other information 
• Health condition.

• Port State Control (PSC).

• International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS).
If a VTS is tasked with providing MSI services, guidance on this type of information is found in IMO Resolution A.706(17)a World-Wide Navigational Warning Service[8].
4.2. MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT OF SHIP TRAFFIC The monitoring and management of ship traffic to ensure the safety and efficiency of ship movements may include: IALA Guideline G1089 Provision of a VTS Edition 2.0 urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1089:ed2.0 P 7 
• Forward planning and prioritization of ship movements to prevent congestion or dangerous situations and improve overall efficiency.

• Organizing ships underway noting that special transports or ships with hazardous or polluting cargo may affect the flow of other traffic.

• Organizing space allocation.
Establishing a system of traffic clearances.
Establishing a system of voyage or passage plans.

• Providing route advice.
Establishing mandatory reporting of movements in the VTS area.
Establishing recommended or advisory routes to be followed.
Establishing speed limits to be observed.

• Organizing nautical activities (e.g., sailing regattas) or marine works in-progress (such as dredging or submarine cable-laying) to avoid interference with the flow of ship traffic.
Ensuring compliance with and enforcement of regulatory provisions for which they are empowered.
4.2.1. EXAMPLES OF THE MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT OF SHIP TRAFFIC Examples of when the monitoring and management of ship traffic might be required include those shown in Table 2: Table 2 Examples of situations that may require monitoring and management of ship traffic Information related to: Examples: 
• On or prior to entering a VTS area.

• Departing from a berth or an anchorage within a VTS area.
Traffic clearance 
• Entering into a fairway within a VTS area.

• Prior to commencing a manoeuvre that may be detrimental to safe navigation.

• Organizing the movements to/from an anchorage position/area.
Anchorage 
• Assigning an anchorage position.

• Assisting ships into anchorage position.

• Ensuring adherence to speed limits.

• Ensuring adherence to rules regarding traffic routeing
