3. IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS
VTS system implementations may require consideration of the following:


3. IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS
VTS system function and performance including, but not limited to :


3. IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS

• Off-the-shelf solution or customized solution


3. IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS
Sensor and radio coverage, including overlapping coverage


3. IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS

• Equipment redundancy


3. IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS

• Communications routes


3. IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS

• External Interfaces


3. IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS
Electromagnetic issues (EMI/EMC)


3. IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS
VTS system sustainability including, but not limited to:


3. IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS

• Lifecycle planning, including environmental impact and sustainability in the choice of materials, power consumptions etc.

3. IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS

• Maintenance of the VTS system and equipment


3. IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS
•


3. IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS
Environmental constraints and impacts such as wind, influence from the sea, precipitation and possibly ice


3. IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS
Locational and infrastructure design should include but not be limited to:


3. IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS

• VTS Centre location(s)


3. IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS
Available land and suitability of sensor sites


3. IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS
Existing infrastructure such as power and data lines


3. IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS
Selection of installation sites with due respect to neighbours


3. IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS

• Security and site access


3. IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS

• Rules and regulations, for example:


3. IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS

• Applicable rules and regulations, i.e.
required licenses (transmission, building etc.)


3. IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS

• Business rules


3. IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS

3. IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS
®


3. IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS

• Organization, for example:


3. IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS

• Administrative functions and roles


3. IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS

• Authorization levels


3. IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS
Any VTS system should, as a minimum, be equipped with means to build a VTS traffic image as well as providing reliable communications.

3. IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS
The system architecture of a VTS system should carefully consider issues such as, but not be limited to:


3. IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS

• Network requirements (bandwidth, latency etc.)


3. IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS

• Redundant data paths


3. IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS

• Data integrity


3. IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS
Security requirements, e.g., physical security, cyber security


3. IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS

• Data storage


3. IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS

• Reporting and recording requirements


3. IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS

• Maintenance of the VTS System and its equipment


3. IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS
In addition, the system architecture should have built-in flexibility for future upgrades and have the capability to be maintained without impacting routine VTS operations.

3. IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS
During the development of the system architecture, comprehensive site surveys should be performed, including but not limited to the above considerations.
Involvement of relevant stakeholders in the site survey early in the process adds value and ensures awareness of the potential risks (e.g., design and performance).
