2.1. THE TECHNICAL INTERFACE
Another important factor to consider, when defining a technical interface, is timing.
This factor can be further

2.1. THE TECHNICAL INTERFACE
divided into:

2.1. THE TECHNICAL INTERFACE
Real-time, i.e., data that changes on a timeframe in a matter of seconds.
2.1. THE TECHNICAL INTERFACE

• Non-real-time, data that changes on a timeframe in a matter of minutes:

2.1. THE TECHNICAL INTERFACE

• Static/semi-static, pertinent data or data that changes infrequently

2.1. THE TECHNICAL INTERFACE

• Historical, i.e., recorded data

2.2. DEFINING THE TECHNICAL INTERFACE
At least, the following aspects should be considered when defining the technical interface:

2.2. DEFINING THE TECHNICAL INTERFACE
The data format, i.e., how will the information be represented:

2.2. DEFINING THE TECHNICAL INTERFACE

• Communication channel characteristics

2.2. DEFINING THE TECHNICAL INTERFACE

• Data model, including semantics

2.2. DEFINING THE TECHNICAL INTERFACE

• Version control
