Careful assessment of the functions required of VTS personnel should be considered to ensure that their primary safety role is not compromised.
The requirement for additional or “call-in” personnel should also be considered when necessary to ensure the primary role is maintained.

Consideration should be given to the rotation of watchkeeping VTS personnel and the need for rest breaks, depending on the intensity of work and the overall working environment.
