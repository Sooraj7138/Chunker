POST IMPLEMENTATION EVALUATION
To achieve the purposes for which it was implemented, a VTS needs to be effective and routinely evaluated to ensure that the operational objectives are being met, the technical and operational performance is acceptable, and the issues identified and defined in determining the need for the VTS have been either alleviated or at least reduced to an acceptable level.
POST IMPLEMENTATION EVALUATION
IALA Guideline G1101 - Auditing and Assessing a VTS provides guidance for competent authorities and VTS providers to meet their obligations under SOLAS for the establishment and operation of a VTS.
In particular, it provides the framework for auditing and assessing a VTS and the subsequent on-going assessment and evaluation to ensure:

POST IMPLEMENTATION EVALUATION
conformity with international obligations;

POST IMPLEMENTATION EVALUATION
the technical performance of the VTS equipment is consistent with the objectives of the VTS;

POST IMPLEMENTATION EVALUATION
the operational objectives are being met; and

POST IMPLEMENTATION EVALUATION

• the degree of risk identified in determining the need for the VTS have been either alleviated or at least reduced to an acceptable level.
POST IMPLEMENTATION EVALUATION
The evaluation may indicate changes to the volume of traffic or the degree of risk have culminated in the need to consider changes such as:

POST IMPLEMENTATION EVALUATION
The delineated VTS area.
POST IMPLEMENTATION EVALUATION
The categories of participating ships.
POST IMPLEMENTATION EVALUATION

• Enhanced capabilities for monitoring and managing ship traffic (e.g.
staffing, decision support capabilities) to ensure the safety and efficiency of ship movements through, for example, the forward planning of ship movements or organizing space allocation.
POST IMPLEMENTATION EVALUATION

• Reduced capabilities to monitor and manage ship traffic (e.g.
staffing, technological capabilities) may adequately address the risks.
POST IMPLEMENTATION EVALUATION

• VTS is longer no longer justified for the area and, for example, a local port service may adequately address the risks.
POST IMPLEMENTATION EVALUATION
In all cases, the evaluation process should take into account IALA standards and associated recommendations and guidelines specifically related to the establishment and operation of VTS to contribute to achieving worldwide harmonization of VTS.
POST IMPLEMENTATION EVALUATION
Where an evaluation indicates the need for a VTS is no longer justified, the Contracting Government/competent should ensure:

POST IMPLEMENTATION EVALUATION
the proposed change is consistent with their international obligations for VTS; and

POST IMPLEMENTATION EVALUATION

• the issues and problems identified and assessed in determining the need for the VTS are no longer evident or can be addressed by alternative passive traffic management measures.
POST IMPLEMENTATION EVALUATION
In such situations a risk assessment should be undertaken to re-assess the waterway as described in Section 5.1 to demonstrate VTS is no longer required as any inherent risks can be mitigated by other means.
