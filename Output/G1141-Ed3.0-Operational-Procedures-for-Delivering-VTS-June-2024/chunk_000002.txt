data, including vessel movement information) 
• Meteorological and hydrographic data 
• Data from other sources The internal procedures should specify the time period for which VTS information is stored.
This time period should be such that it allows for the full retrieval of data post-incident/accident, in compliance with national requirements and those of the incident/accident investigation procedures of the VTS provider and other interested parties.
EQUIPMENT OPERATION, MAINTENANCE, CALIBRATION AND UPDATING All manuals and handbooks for equipment operation, maintenance (preventative and remedial), calibration and updating should be properly maintained and readily available to the appropriate personnel.
Key considerations include: 
• Descriptions of equipment and systems used in the VTS 
• Operation of equipment to cover all normal and emergency procedures 
• Determining performance availability criteria for equipment, including the availability of VTS during maintenance or other outages Categorization and prioritization of maintenance and defects Calibration of sensors within a specified tolerance level 
• Updates to equipment (hardware and software) and their associated manuals/handbooks VTS availability due to maintenance or other outages.
4.1.4. PUBLIC RELATIONS There should be documented processes and procedures to deal with media and public relations issues.
Issues for consideration may include: 
• Nominated lead department for public relations Publication of ongoing activities within the VTS area Protection of sensitive information 4.1.5. SECURITY Processes and procedures should be clearly documented and consistent with local and national requirements.
As a minimum, they should ensure the security for: 
• Data transmission and storage (e.g., Cyber Security); VTS personnel; and VTS buildings and structures.
Procedures should reflect any involvement of the VTS with the Port Facility Security Plan (PFSP) as per the International Ship and Port facility Security Code (ISPS) [7].
4.1.6. TRAINING Processes and procedures should be available to ensure that: VTS personnel are appropriately trained and qualified for their VTS duties; IALA Guideline G1141 Operational Procedures for Delivering VTS Edition 3.0 urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1141:ed3.0 P 7 
• Qualifications and operational performance are maintained and confirmed through performance assessments undertaken at regular intervals; and Training records of VTS personnel are maintained.
Please note, that Guideline G1156 Recruitment, training and assessment of VTS personnel [8] provides further guidance on the training and assessment of VTS personnel.
4.1.7. WATCH HANDOVER Watch handover arrangements should be formalized and include, as an example, information on: Present traffic situation; Expected/developing traffic situations; Incidents and special operations (e.g., SAR or military operations); 
• Waterway conditions; Environmental conditions (e.g., meteorological conditions and tidal conditions); 
• Status of AtoN; Equipment performance/availability; Status of allied services (e.g., pilotage, port and tug services); Personnel availability; Appropriate times for watch handover; and 
• Method for documenting the handover.
4.1.8. VESSEL HANDOVER The arrangements for vessel handover between adjacent sectors or areas should be clearly laid down.
Components may include: 
• Mutual understanding of the handover procedures.

• Identification of information to be communicated between operators (e.g., communication channel, vessel identification, etc.).

• Method for documenting the vessel handover.
4.1.9. MAINTENANCE OF NAUTICAL PUBLICATIONS AND CHARTS A VTS provider should ensure that arrangements are in place for maintaining, updating and disseminating nautical publications and charts (paper and/or electronic).
CASUALTY, INCIDENTS AND NEAR-MISS RECORDING The arrangements for the gathering and exchange of information on incidents, accidents and/or near-misses in the VTS area should be described.
This may include processes and procedures to ensure that all recording equipment is operating correctly.
This may also include the procedures for incident reporting and dissemination of information to relevant parties.
Please note, IALA Guideline G1118 Marine casualty / incident reporting and recording, including near‐miss situations as it relates to VTS [9] provides further information on developing and establishing processes for the reporting, recording and analysis of marine casualties, incidents and near-miss situations.
IALA Guideline G1141 Operational Procedures for Delivering VTS Edition 3.0 urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1141:ed3.0 P 8 4.1.11. ADMINISTRATIVE/ MANAGEMENT Processes and procedures should be implemented to demonstrate that the responsibilities, practices, policies and procedures exercised by an authority to provide strategic direction, ensure objectives, manage risk and use resources responsibly and with accountability are monitored and evaluated on a routine basis.
This should include documentation relating to: 
• VTS Objectives – Procedures to monitor and assess that the objectives set for the VTS are met and regularly reported to management.
Aspects and considerations include: 
• Setting performance measures, including both positive (leading) and negative (lag) performance measures; Establishing a framework to regularly assess the performance measures; and Reporting to management.
Evaluation – Procedures to regularly carry out an evaluation to ensure that the VTS operational objectives have been met, and the problems identified and defined for implementing the VTS have been either alleviated or at least reduced to an acceptable level.
Aspects and considerations in undertaking the evaluation include: 
• 
• The need for the VTS, which may include monitoring and identifying changes that may have occurred since the VTS
