6.1. OVERVIEW
The aim of this part is to establish globally harmonized standard phrases for use by a VTS.
VTS personnel should be familiar with these phrases, which should be remembered for immediate recall.
It follows that the number of standard VTS phrases should be limited to those that VTS personnel can reasonably be expected to learn and this section, therefore, restricts the number of standard phrases to those operational circumstances where it is judged that time may be critical or where misunderstandings might compromise safety.
6.1. OVERVIEW
Message markers have intentionally not been included in the standard phrases as the appropriate message marker may differ dependent on the context.
6.1. OVERVIEW
These standard phrases are not intended to replace or contradict the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 or special local rules or recommendations made by IMO concerning ships' routeing.
Neither are they intended to supersede the International Code of Signals [8] nor to replace normal radiotelephone practice as set out in the ITU Radio Regulations.
They are designed to complement the phrases in SMCP adapting them as necessary to align with current recognized best practice, recognising that SMCP has not been updated since 2001.
