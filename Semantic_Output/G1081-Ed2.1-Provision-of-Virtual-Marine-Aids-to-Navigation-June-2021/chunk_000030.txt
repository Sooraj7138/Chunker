In Figure 7, on the left, from the IEC standard, the Missing Virtual AIS AtoN symbol for an absent charted physical AtoN.
On the right, an actual display on a vessel ECDIS.
8.2.4. POINT AND AREA REPRESENTATION
In addition to the use of the AtoN Report Message 21, emerging AIS Application Specific Messages (ASM) could be used to provide a representation of a point position, line, area, or other forms that may be displayed graphically.
The portrayal has been developed in the latest IEC 62288 [31].
As navigational display manufacturers incorporate them into their systems, users will be able to fully benefit from this feature.
