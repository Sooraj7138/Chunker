ANNEX A EXAMPLES FOR SETTING OBJECTIVES AND MEASURING THEM
Overview of Traffic and Maintaining a Traffic Image The purpose of a VTS is to contribute to safety of life at sea, safety and efficiency of navigation and the protection of the environment within the VTS The system is capable of compiling a traffic image throughout the VTS area.
The sensor coverage is reliable and consistent throughout area by mitigating the development of unsafe the VTS area.

(Refer A.1158(32) 3 Capability to interact with a vessel to influence the decision‐making process on board the vessel.

• The availability of the traffic image is greater than or equal to 99.8% for a <set period>.

• The availability of VHF voice communication systems (or other interaction instruments) throughout the VTS area is greater than or equal to, for example, 99.8% for a set period.

• The decision support tools escalate 100% of occurrences where vessels deviate from a recommended track.

• The decision support tools escalate 100% of occurrences where vessels encroach upon the defined CPA.

• Percentage of interventions which successfully influenced the decision‐making process on board the vessel i.e., the interventions successfully avoided an incident or accident.

• The VTS Operations room is manned 24/7.
