This guidance can include, for example, the use of structured courses, simulation exercises, or other approved formats.

VTS providers should have processes and procedures in place to ensure that VTS personnel complete revalidation training within the timeframes and guidance provided by the competent authority.

Where VTS personnel hold additional qualifications, such as VTS supervisors or OJT instructors, they are expected to maintain the competencies required for these roles.
Competent Authorities may determine the revalidation requirements, which could include attending a structured revalidation course aligned with the original model course (e.g.
C0103-2 and C0103-4) or other comparable approaches such as:

9.3. REVALIDATION TRAINING

• Demonstrating continued competence through active supervisory duties or instructional activities.

• Using other approved methods that ensure continued competence in leadership, mentoring, and assessment.
9.3. REVALIDATION TRAINING
Revalidation training may be delivered either by an accredited VTS Training Organization, or a VTS provider approved to provide revalidation training for their own personnel.
It is acknowledged that, depending on how the training program is structured, both an accredited VTS Training Organization and the VTS provider may be involved in developing and delivering training activities.
