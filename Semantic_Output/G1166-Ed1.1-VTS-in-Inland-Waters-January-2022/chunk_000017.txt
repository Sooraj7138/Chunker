Three risk management tools are offered in guidelines:

4.12.1. IALA GUIDANCE

• G1138 The Use of the Simplified IALA Risk Assessment Method (SIRA).
4.12.2. INLAND WATERS CONSIDERATIONS
The guidance on the assessment of risk is based on international, territorial and coastal areas and in ports/harbours.
The tools set out in the IWRAP and PAWSA models may prove to be too sophisticated for an inland waterway.
However, SIRA provides a simpler process that may be more relevant.
Nevertheless, all draw on the capture of AIS information as important source data and this may still be very relevant to risk assessment of inland waters where such data can be gathered.
4.12.2. INLAND WATERS CONSIDERATIONS
While the IALA recommendation R0119 on the establishment of a VTS and the associated Guideline G1150 on establishing, planning and implementing a VTS are based on the requirements for SOLAS vessels and IMO provisions, these documents set out basic principles, many of which will also be of significant relevance to an inland

VTS.
4.12.2. INLAND WATERS CONSIDERATIONS
