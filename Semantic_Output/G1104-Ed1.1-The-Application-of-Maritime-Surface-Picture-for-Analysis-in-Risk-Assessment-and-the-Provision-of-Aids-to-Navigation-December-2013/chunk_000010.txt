POSSIBLE LIMITATIONS TO BE CONSIDERED WITH AIS DATA
The data and information that is gained through AIS traffic analysis must be treated with a certain amount of

POSSIBLE LIMITATIONS TO BE CONSIDERED WITH AIS DATA
caution:

POSSIBLE LIMITATIONS TO BE CONSIDERED WITH AIS DATA
The data received from the vessel, other than position information, is dependent on the accuracy of the input from the vessel.
POSSIBLE LIMITATIONS TO BE CONSIDERED WITH AIS DATA
There are many instances where ship dynamic AIS data such as draught and destination are incorrect or suspect.
POSSIBLE LIMITATIONS TO BE CONSIDERED WITH AIS DATA
Many users of AtoN are not required to carry AIS transceivers.
POSSIBLE LIMITATIONS TO BE CONSIDERED WITH AIS DATA
Although many leisure craft now carry AIS class B, this is not mandatory, and as such, this sector of the user community must be further considered using other data inputs.
For example, a yachting routing atlas, as a GIS overlay.
POSSIBLE LIMITATIONS TO BE CONSIDERED WITH AIS DATA
AIS data is generally received from a network of base stations.
POSSIBLE LIMITATIONS TO BE CONSIDERED WITH AIS DATA
The data will become less reliable the further the area being considered is offshore.
There is not a firm line between good and poor data with differing atmospheric conditions affecting reception at different times.
Data received from further offshore, including AIS satellite data, must be treated with caution.
POSSIBLE LIMITATIONS TO BE CONSIDERED WITH AIS DATA
The volume and type of marine traffic may be subject to variations on an hourly, daily, weekly or seasonal basis, e.g., fishing and tourist / leisure activities during the summer or traffic movements by local ferries at certain times of the day.

6. CONCLUSION
The assessment process for the provision of AtoN must rely mainly on the qualitative assessment of experts.
The diversity of the various aspects that have to be considered will include the vast assortment and variety of vessels, the experience of the mariners involved and the very different parameters that exist at the different locations.

6. CONCLUSION
This qualitative assessment can now be informed by the quantitative, statistical elements provided by AIS traffic analysis data and GIS overlays; subject to the possible inaccuracies in overall AIS data.

6. CONCLUSION
It is essential that every opportunity is taken to provide the correct control measures to mitigate risk.
These include the most appropriate mix of AtoN and consideration of navigation aids available on board the vessels in question.

6. CONCLUSION
It is also essential that resources are used appropriately without any negative effect on the safety of the mariner.
In depth AIS traffic analysis can inform decisions to ensure that maximum efficiencies are achieved.

7. DEFINITIONS
The definitions of terms used in this Guideline can be found in the International Dictionary of Marine Aids to Navigation (IALA Dictionary) and were checked as correct at the time of going to print.
