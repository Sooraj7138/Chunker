Risk – Identifying and assessing the hazards associated with the volume of traffic and degree of risk in the waterway.

• Operational feasibility - Does implementing a VTS meet the needs of the entity by solving problems and/or taking advantage of identified opportunities?

• Legality - What are the legal requirements to implement a VTS and can these requirements be met?

• Technical capability - Does the entity have the technical capabilities and resources to undertake implementing a VTS?

• Budget - Does the entity have the financial resources available, and is the cost/benefit analysis sufficient to justify implementing a VTS?
Time - Can a VTS be implemented in a reasonable timeline?
To support this phase a process of comprehensive information gathering, and analysis is inevitably involved.
This will enable relevant issues and problems in the maritime area to be identified, assessed, defined, and analyzed.
Possible issues and problems relating to ship traffic include: Interaction of maritime traffic Volume and composition of traffic Protection of the marine environment and the surrounding area The local conditions such as geography, hydrological/meteorological, and tides Whilst there are many different risk management methodologies, IALA offers three risk management tools for assessing the risks in waterways when initiating and planning a VTS.
Annex A contains a list of considerations (many of which are incorporated in the IALA risk management toolbox), to assist in: determining the need for a VTS; 
• defining the functional requirements needed to achieve the desired level of safety and efficiency and protection of the environment; and 
• determining the costs associated with implementing a VTS and whether the expected reduction in risk would be justified in terms of the level of investment required.
Key components of the IALA risk management toolbox include: 
• PAWSA – The Ports and Waterways Risk Assessment (PAWSA) tool provides a structured and systematic approach to: identify major waterway safety hazards; estimate risk levels, evaluate potential mitigation measures; and 
• set the stage for implementation of selected measures to reduce risk.
As a qualitative tool, PAWSA is exploratory and the analysis seeks to get a deeper understanding of why a certain phenomenon occurs, its associated consequences and the potential effectiveness of additional mitigation measures.
IALA Guideline G1150 Establishing, Planning and Implementing a VTS Edition 3.1 urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1150:ed3.1 @ P 9 A comprehensive explanation of PAWSA Mk II can be found in IALA Guideline G1124 [11].

• IWRAP - The IALA Waterway Risk Assessment Program (IWRAP) risk assessment process provides a standardized, quantitative method to evaluate the probability of collisions and groundings in a given waterway.
Using AIS data IWRAP is a Windows-based software program, allowing for different scenarios to be developed, so that changes such as those in traffic volume or composition, route geometry, aids to navigation or the introduction of other mitigating measures, can be modelled.
A comprehensive explanation of IWRAP can be found in IALA Guideline G1123 [12].

• SIRA - The Simplified IALA Risk Assessment (SIRA) is a simplified qualitative method to assess the volume of traffic and degree of risk and identify potential risk mitigation options to reduce the risks to acceptable levels.
SIRA is particularly applicable where good quality AIS data, on which IWRAP depends, is not available or where access to individuals with the necessary level of experience in the risk categories used by PAWSA is limited.
A comprehensive explanation of SIRA can be found in IALA Guideline G1138 [13].
A key outcome of the project’s initiation phase is the determination of the project’s viability prior to committing the required staff, materials, and finances to the project.
Completion of this phase will enable authorities to determine whether a VTS provides a viable solution to address the issues and problems identified and assessed as part of the feasibility study (and to proceed to Phase 2 (Planning) and Phase 3 (Implementing)) or if alternative passive traffic management measures may adequately address the issues and problems identified.
Examples of possible passive traffic management measures are provided in annex B.
Alternatively, it may be determined that a VTS should be implemented, possibly in conjunction with additional or enhanced passive traffic management measures.
5.2. PHASE 2: PLANNING In the planning phase, competent authorities should ensure: 
• They are conversant with all IALA standards, recommendations, guidelines and model courses specifically related to the implementation and operation of a VTS.

• They can demonstrate compliance with all the normative provisions of these standards (as explained in Section 4.3).
Once the project is approved to move forward based on the outcomes from Phase 1, the planning phase commences.
This phase is key to successful delivery and focuses on developing a roadmap for everyone to follow.
Information collated in Phase 1 as part of preparing documents such as a business case and feasibility study will provide input to the planning phase.
