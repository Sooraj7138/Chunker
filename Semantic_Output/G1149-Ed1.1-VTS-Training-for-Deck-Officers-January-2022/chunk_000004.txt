1.1. BACKGROUND
An effective vessel traffic service improves the safety and efficiency of navigation, the safety of life at sea and the protection of the marine environment from possible adverse effects of maritime traffic.
1.1. BACKGROUND
SOLAS regulation V/12 provides the basis for vessel traffic services (VTS) and is supported by IMO resolutions, guidelines and circulars.
The importance of VTS is furthermore referenced in the Manila Amendments to the STCW 1978 Convention.
1.1. BACKGROUND
An efficient VTS relies upon the co-operation between the bridge team and the VTS operator (VTSO).
The effectiveness of information exchange depends upon each party's understanding of their respective functions and responsibilities.
Increased knowledge and understanding of a VTS by the bridge team will enhance teamwork between VTS and ships and improve safe navigation.
1.1. BACKGROUND
It is recognized that not all deck officers have the same knowledge level of VTS.
A higher level of knowledge of VTS will enable better use of their services, resulting in enhanced situational awareness.
1.2. APPLICATION
This Guideline contains recommendations that complement the standard of competence provided in the STCW Code for the deck department in order to enhance their understanding of VTS.
It could also be used by other relevant stakeholders, such as flag states, harbour and port organizations, pilot organizations and shipping companies.

2. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES
This Guideline presents guidance and information to be used by maritime training organizations in the development of training on VTS as an integral part of the training of deck officers.
This document also provides examples of activities that could be used to facilitate effective communications and the exchange of information between the bridge team and the VTSO.
3.1. TERMS USED IN VTS

• Vessel traffic service (VTS) - a service implemented by a competent authority, designed to improve the safety and efficiency of vessel traffic and to protect the environment.
The service should have the capability to interact with the traffic and to respond to traffic situations developing in the VTS area.
3.1. TERMS USED IN VTS

• Competent authority - the authority made responsible, in whole or in part, by the Government for safety, including environmental safety, and efficiency of vessel traffic and the protection of the environment.
3.1. TERMS USED IN VTS

• VTS authority - the authority with responsibility for the management, operation and co-ordination of the VTS, interaction with participating ships and the safe and effective provision of the service.

3.1. TERMS USED IN VTS
•

3.1. TERMS USED IN VTS
VTS area - the delineated, formally declared service area of the VTS.
A VTS area may be subdivided in sub-areas or sectors.
3.1. TERMS USED IN VTS

• VTS operator - an appropriately qualified person performing one or more tasks contributing to the services of the VTS.
3.1. TERMS USED IN VTS

• VTS centre - the centre from which the VTS is operated.
Each sub-area of the VTS may have its own sub-centre.
3.1. TERMS USED IN VTS

• Allied services - services actively involved in the safe and efficient passage of the vessel through the VTS area.
3.2. WHERE TO FIND INFORMATION ABOUT A VTS
The services offered by a VTS to the mariner are promulgated to ships in nautical charts and publications.
This includes details of the VTS, its capabilities, rules, regulations, requirements, radio frequencies and procedures.
3.2. WHERE TO FIND INFORMATION ABOUT A VTS
It is recommended that deck officers should obtain the official “VTS Users Guide” from appropriate nautical publications or websites.
Further information may be also obtained from IALA Guideline G1144 Promulgating the requirements of a VTS to mariners – a VTS users guide template.
3.3. PARTICIPATION IN VTS
As identified in SOLAS regulation V/12, participation in a VTS may be mandatory within the territorial seas.
A VTS may be applicable to all ships or there may be exemptions to certain types and sizes of ships.
It should be noted that ships that are not required to participate in a VTS may still choose to do so.
A VTS may also be implemented beyond the territorial seas.
3.4. PURPOSE, OBJECTIVES, ROLES AND FUNCTIONS OF VTS
VTS is recognized internationally as a navigational safety measure through SOLAS regulation V/12. VTS is implemented under a national legal framework adhering to international standards and recommendations.
3.4.1. PURPOSE OF VTS
The purpose of vessel traffic services is to contribute to safety of life at sea, safety and efficiency of navigation and the protection of the marine environment within the VTS area by mitigating the development of unsafe situations.
VTS may also have a role to play in security.
3.4.1. PURPOSE OF VTS
The main benefits of a VTS for the deck officer include:

3.4.1. PURPOSE OF VTS

• Aiding in the safe and efficient use of navigable waterways.
3.4.1. PURPOSE OF VTS

• Affording unhindered access to pursue commercial activities, subject to any restrictions that may exist.
3.4.1. PURPOSE OF VTS

• Contributing to keeping the seas and adjacent environment free from pollution.
3.4.1. PURPOSE OF VTS
There may be additional operational objectives specific to that VTS, which take account of the volume of traffic, degree of risk, geographic and environmental conditions within the VTS area.
3.4.2. ROLES
By monitoring the movements of ships within the VTS area, the VTSO is able to interact with ships in accordance with established regulations and procedures.
