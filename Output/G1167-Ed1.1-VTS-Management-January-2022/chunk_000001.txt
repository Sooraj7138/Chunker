3. PRINCIPLES OF MANAGEMENT PROCESSES Management is described as undertaking the activities appropriate to achieving defined purposes and objectives by the use of human and other resources.
The following principles are indicative of those that should be considered when applying management processes: 
• Clear, transparent and unambiguous 
• Agile 
• Realistic 
• Human-centred 
• Aimed at the objectives 
• Strategically planned 
• Consistent VTS providers may consider using the PLAN -> DO -> CHECK -> ACT (PDCA) cycle when applying management processes.
This four-step model assists with managing business processes and ensures a continuous process of improvement.
It helps to identify goals and plan actions, deploy the means to achieve them, evaluate the results, and finally check what adjustments might be necessary.
The model is designed to operate at all levels and can be applied to all processes.
The PDCA cycle includes: Planning: investigating needs, identifying goals and determining courses of action; 1 Doing/organizing: implementing courses of action, coordinating resources, motivating and directing people.
2 Checking: monitoring and evaluating results, determining adjustments and improvements.
Act: implement improvements and adjustments.
The PDCA cycle is repetitive and provides an environment of continuous improvement, see Figure 1: PLAN DO ACT CHECK Figure 1 The Plan, Do, Check, Act cycle IALA Guideline G1167 VTS Management Edition 1.0 urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1167:ed1.0 P 5 Table 1 below describes management activities in the PDCA cycle and sets out two VTS examples.

4. MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES The VTS provider should ensure management activities are in place to ensure the provision of VTS is consistent with their responsibilities as defined in IMO Resolution A.1158(32) and any additional requirements identified by their competent authority.
Activities that may be associated with the management of a VTS are described below.
In planning and organizing the management framework, these activities could be allocated to one person or may involve multiple people depending on the structure of the organization.
The VTS provider should ensure the management structure is optimized for achieving the objectives of the VTS.
4.1. OPERATIONAL Operational aspects involve managing and co-ordinating the day-to-day operations and the objectives set for the VTS.
Associated activities may include: 
• managing day-to-day activities associated with the provision of VTS; ongoing evaluation of activities the VTS provides which may impact workload or staffing levels; 
• maintaining VTS operational procedures; 
• monitoring and managing VTS operational performance; interface with allied services and stakeholders; and undertake operational needs analysis.
4.2. HUMAN RESOURCES Human resource aspects involve those related to staffing and human elements within the structure of the VTS.
Associated activities may include: IALA Guideline G1167 VTS Management Edition 1.0 urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1167:ed1.0 P 6 
• establishing policies and processes associated with the selection and recruitment of VTS personnel including the development of job descriptions; recruiting VTS personnel considering, for example: 
• the VTS staffing levels; 
• personal attributes; 
• aptitude testing; 
• assessment of prior learning; and satisfying the medical/physical requirements.

• managing employee personnel files (e.g., contracts, hours worked, payroll, sick leave, disciplinary notes);

• managing human factors and workplace ergonomics; and determining long term staffing needs (e.g., succession planning).
4.3. TRAINING Training aspects involve managing and implementing processes to ensure VTS personnel are appropriately trained and qualified.
Associated activities may include: planning and coordinating of VTS training (IALA model courses and other training as appropriate); determining training needs for VTS personnel; determining training equipment requirements; selecting suitable instructors and assessors to deliver VTS centre specific training; 
• assessing competencies to determine that VTS personnel are appropriately trained and qualified for their VTS duties; 
• undertaking regular VTS performance assessments to ensure that the established competency continues to be met; and 
• maintaining training records.
4.4. TECHNICAL VTS should be provided with appropriate equipment, systems and facilities to effectively accomplish its objectives.
Associated activities may include: identifying appropriate equipment, systems and facilities to meet the needs of the VTS; 
• procurement and installation of equipment, systems and facilities
