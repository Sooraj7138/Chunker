3.1. AVAILABILITY AND RELIABILITY
The VTS provider can decide whether individual sub-systems are critical or non-critical.
Non-critical sub-systems may be excluded from the overall system availability requirement.
3.1. AVAILABILITY AND RELIABILITY
Note that multiple means of communications and overlapping sensor coverage will increase overall availability.
Such a solution may result in reduced requirements for the availability of each item of equipment individually.
3.1. AVAILABILITY AND RELIABILITY
Scheduled maintenance activities may be included in availability figures.
3.1. AVAILABILITY AND RELIABILITY
Also note that required spare parts should be readily available, to ensure the shortest time to repair.
Therefore, VTS providers should plan for sufficient spare parts and service arrangements, or business continuation plans in order to meet the availability criteria.
3.1. AVAILABILITY AND RELIABILITY
The VTS system availability may be improved by the following redundancy measures:

3.1. AVAILABILITY AND RELIABILITY
•

3.1. AVAILABILITY AND RELIABILITY
by duplicating hardware and/or by using externally hosted VTS system and equipment - in duplicated hardware systems, hand-over procedures from active to stand-by equipment should be considered;

3.1. AVAILABILITY AND RELIABILITY
by siting sensors such as radio and radar aerials to provide partial overlapping coverage; and

3.1. AVAILABILITY AND RELIABILITY
by facilitating gradual reduction of capabilities in individual VTS Equipment.
3.2. RECORDING, ARCHIVING AND REPLAY
Within legal limitations, provision should be made for secure storage, retrieval and presentation of VTS data so the relevant historical data can be easily recalled and played back.
3.2. RECORDING, ARCHIVING AND REPLAY
The data retention period should allow for the full retrieval of data post-incident/accident, in compliance with national requirements and those of the investigation procedures.
3.2. RECORDING, ARCHIVING AND REPLAY
Stored and archived data should include, but not be limited to:

3.2. RECORDING, ARCHIVING AND REPLAY

• VTS traffic image

3.2. RECORDING, ARCHIVING AND REPLAY

• Sensor data

3.2. RECORDING, ARCHIVING AND REPLAY

• Voice communication

3.2. RECORDING, ARCHIVING AND REPLAY

• Other relevant information

3.2. RECORDING, ARCHIVING AND REPLAY
It may also include (within legal limitations):

3.2. RECORDING, ARCHIVING AND REPLAY
Internal VTS personnel conversations inside the VTS centre

3.2. RECORDING, ARCHIVING AND REPLAY

• VTS personnel activities

3.2. RECORDING, ARCHIVING AND REPLAY

• Technical and maintenance requirements, e.g., logging, failure tracking, long term failure statistics and analysis, system performance monitoring and improvement

3.2. RECORDING, ARCHIVING AND REPLAY
The data should be recorded automatically and be capable of replay without impact to on-going VTS operations.
Synchronization of information is recommended for replay.
3.2. RECORDING, ARCHIVING AND REPLAY
Data security should always be considered especially when providing online storage.
Long term archiving may be considered for traffic statistics, risks evaluation, strategic planning etc.
