4.14.2. INLAND WATERS CONSIDERATIONS
Many inland waterways draw heavily on AIS as a primary tool for vessel tracking, and it is important that the capabilities and limitations of AIS are fully understood.
Much of IALA’s Guideline G1082 Overview of AIS has equal relevance to inland VTS.
4.14.2. INLAND WATERS CONSIDERATIONS
The specifications for AIS equipment on inland waterway vessels may differ from those for AIS on seagoing ships.
For example, in Europe, the specification for AIS on inland waterway vessels (Inland AIS) is based on AIS Class A but requires additional functionality to meet the needs of inland navigation.
4.14.2. INLAND WATERS CONSIDERATIONS
There may be a higher proportion of vessels equipped with AIS Class B in inland waters.
4.14.2. INLAND WATERS CONSIDERATIONS
An inland VTS may need to consider how AIS data from both inland waterway vessels and seagoing ships are presented on a VTS traffic image display system and how the AIS information can be checked for accuracy.
4.14.2. INLAND WATERS CONSIDERATIONS
The buoyage system applied in inland waters may also be different from the IALA buoyage system.
This should be taken into account to avoid, as far as possible, any risk of conflict or confusion between the two systems of buoyage and particularly where there is a transition between the different buoyage systems.
4.14.2. INLAND WATERS CONSIDERATIONS
The PIANC guidance “Guidelines and Recommendations for River Information Services (2019)” [5] and the PIANC report “E-Navigation for Inland Waterways (2017)” [6] may also be of relevance in considering VTS in Inland Waters.
