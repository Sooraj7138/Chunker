• Mechanical Safety 
• Radiation Safety Electromagnetic Compatibility Radio Spectrum licensing 
• Hazardous / Chemical Substances 
4. DEFINITIONS The following definitions apply within this document and in all the G1111 series of guideline documents: the VTS system is the VTS software, hardware, communications and sensors.
This VTS system – excludes personnel and procedures.
VTS equipment refers to the individual items of software, hardware, VTS equipment – communications and sensors, which make up the VTS system.
VTS user is defined as someone with either an operational, technical, or VTS user - administrative need to use or access the VTS system.
