1.2. BACKGROUND
The process of identifying and reporting marine casualties has been clearly established by IMO (MSC Res.255(84)[1]).

1.2. BACKGROUND
Casualties are often preceded by many minor marine incidents or near-misses.
The analysis of marine incidents and near-misses could help VTS providers and other authorities in reviewing its safety of navigation infrastructures, procedures and/or regulations.

The reporting and analysis of incidents and near-misses are recognized in environments where risk-management is essential as a fundamental aspect of safety management (see for example, the ICAO Safety Management Manual [3] for the aviation industry).
