Competencies for Planning and Implementing a VTS Phase Element The principles and practices associated with: 
• Business Case - This document identifies the need for a VTS, providing justification for implementing a VTS, including evaluation of the benefits, cost and risk of alternative options and provides a rationale for the preferred solution.

• Feasibility Study – This document establishes whether a VTS is a viable solution to address the issue or problem.

• Risk Assessment - To support the feasibility study a process of comprehensive information gathering, and analysis is inevitably involved to enable relevant issues and problems in the maritime area to be identified, assessed, defined, and analysed.

1. Initiating IALA recommends the use of the IALA risk management toolbox for assessing the risks in waterways when initiating and planning a VTS.

Competencies for Planning and Implementing a VTS Phase Element 
• Project plan – identifies the project timeline, including the phases of the project, the tasks to be performed, and possible constraints (for example, financial budgets, resourcing etc).

• Functional requirements – defining the operational behaviours and functions the VTS is to accomplish to achieve its objectives.

• Risk plan – identifies anticipated risks and issues that may cause potential quality roadblocks and to mitigate those risks.

• Communications plan – to establish the appropriate level of communication engagement with stakeholders.

• Procurement plan – the purchasing requirements to meet the needs of the proposed VTS.

• Acceptance plan – to identify the tasks that need to be completed to implement a VTS and the criteria that must be met before the VTS is declared operational.
Skills to coordinate and direct project resources to:

• meet the objectives and deliverables described in the project plan; and 
• manage the financial and resourcing aspects of the project.
Monitoring and controlling skills to keep the project on track by ensuring that the project 
4. Controlling remains within scope, on time and on budget so that the project proceeds with minimal risk.
Skills to close out the implementation, including signing off that the final deliverables of implementing the VTS have been met.
