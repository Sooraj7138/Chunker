8.1. TECHNICAL ASPECTS
This Guideline addresses near-term and long-term options for delivery of a Virtual AtoN service.
8.1. TECHNICAL ASPECTS
In the near term, shore-based AIS networks provide competent authorities with the means to operate an information service for shore-based VTS, traffic management schemes, ship reporting systems and other shore- based safety-related services, including Virtual AtoN services.
This service consists of information delivery from ship-to-shore and vice versa.
8.1. TECHNICAL ASPECTS
Technical details of the AIS technology and of the layout and local configuration of shore-based AIS are described in IALA Recommendation R0124 The AIS Service (A-124) [21].
8.1. TECHNICAL ASPECTS
In the longer term, competent authorities may expect that other media for information services will become available.
This would enable Virtual AtoN services to be transmitted via means other than AIS, for example: satcom /internet; WiMAX; VDES, VDE-SAT, NAVDAT, IALA maritime beacon system; cell phone data transmission protocol, etc.
8.1. TECHNICAL ASPECTS
In the near term, not all vessels can be expected to be able to effectively display Virtual AtoN information.
As of July 2008, SOLAS radars are required to interface to AIS and display AIS information, as in MSC Resolution 192(79) [3].
Although ECDIS is capable of displaying AIS information, it is not required to do so.
Based on current rates of navigational system upgrades, it is expected to take at least some years before a substantial percentage of the international commercial fleet will have this capability.
Changes in mandatory carriage requirements may accelerate this development for SOLAS vessels.
PPU Navigational Systems may facilitate implementation on the charting side for pilots but not on radar.
Economic benefit to the shipping industry could also provide an impetus to early adoption of this technology.
8.1. TECHNICAL ASPECTS
The nominal report rate of Virtual AIS AtoN broadcasts is specified in ITU-R-M.1371. However, due to the limitations in data link capacity, IALA Recommendation R0126 [22] recommends a more flexible approach to be considered, taking data link capacity and power consumption at transmitting stations into account.
8.1. TECHNICAL ASPECTS
In the longer term, different report rates may be implemented on different communication media, as appropriate.
