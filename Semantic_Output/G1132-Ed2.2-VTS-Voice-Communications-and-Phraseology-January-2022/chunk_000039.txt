5.2.11. DISTRESS AND SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS
Guidance on distress and safety communications is provided in the ITU publication Radio Regulations Volume 1 (2020) Chapter VII.
[6]This includes distress (MAYDAY), urgency (PAN PAN) and safety (SECURITÉ) calls and messages and operational procedures for such calls over Digital Selective Calling (DSC) or voice channels.
5.2.11. DISTRESS AND SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS
More detailed guidance is published by IMO in the GMDSS Manual [10] which includes:

5.2.11. DISTRESS AND SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS

• “distress, … urgency … and safety ….
communications shall have absolute priority over all other transmissions”.
5.2.11. DISTRESS AND SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS

• “All stations which receive a distress alert or a call transmitted on the distress and safety frequencies … shall immediately cease any transmission capable of interfering, ….
set watch on the radiotelephone frequency associated ….
and prepare for subsequent traffic”.
5.2.11. DISTRESS AND SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS

• “Coast station … in receipt of distress alerts or distress calls shall ensure that they are routed as soon as possible to a rescue coordination centre”.
5.2.11. DISTRESS AND SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS
A VTS may receive distress and safety communications (e.g., VTS working channel or VHF channel 16).
VTS personnel should, therefore, be trained and practiced in responding to distress and safety communications.
5.3. HOW TO INTERPRET A MESSAGE
Interpretation of the message requires skills such as encoding in order to achieve effective communications.
Just as confusion can arise from errors in encoding, it can also arise from decoding especially during emergency situations.
There could be a number of reasons (internal/external factors) that influence the decoding procedures which should be considered, see Figure 1 below.

5.3.1. EFFECTIVE LISTENING SKILLS
Effective listening skills are used to actively understand information provided by the speaker and it can be categorized into the following steps:

5.3.1.1. Listening
Listening involves the reception of sounds from the sender by:

5.3.1.1. Listening

• avoiding interruptions;

5.3.1.1. Listening

• clearing one's mind of distractions; and

5.3.1.1. Listening

• focusing on the speaker.
5.3.1.2. Clarity
The sender and receiver both have a responsibility to ensure that what is said is understood:

5.3.1.2. Clarity
Ask open questions to probe for further detail if required.
5.3.1.2. Clarity
Avoid asking leading questions.
5.3.1.2. Clarity
Avoid coming to conclusions before the sender finishes.
5.3.1.2. Clarity
Be aware of the sender’s choice and application of words.
5.3.1.2. Clarity
Encourage feedback through questioning.
5.3.1.3. Interpretation
Interpretation not only requires verification of what the sender has said, but also the understanding of the information given.
5.3.1.3. Interpretation
Steps to ensure understanding are:

5.3.1.3. Interpretation
Communicate your interpretation and verify its accuracy.
5.3.1.3. Interpretation

• Identify the main issues.
5.3.1.3. Interpretation

• Do not assume what the sender will say, particularly when receiving routine communications.

5.3.2. CLOSED LOOP COMMUNICATIONS [READ-BACK]
Misunderstandings in messages received may include half-heard words or guessed-at numbers.
The potential for misunderstanding increases with the complexity of messages and may cause the bridge team to:

5.3.2. CLOSED LOOP COMMUNICATIONS [READ-BACK]
accept inadequate information received; or

5.3.2. CLOSED LOOP COMMUNICATIONS [READ-BACK]

• determine for themselves the most probable interpretation.
5.3.2. CLOSED LOOP COMMUNICATIONS [READ-BACK]
Closed-loop communication is a technique used to avoid misunderstandings.
The sender gives a message, the receiver repeats a received message, or an appropriate part thereof, back to the sender to obtain confirmation of correct reception.
5.3.2. CLOSED LOOP COMMUNICATIONS [READ-BACK]
When the receiver correctly repeats the message back, the sender will say “YES” (a response in the affirmative).
When the receiver incorrectly repeats the message back, the sender will say “NO” (a response in the negative) and repeat the correct message.
If the sender, the person giving the message, does not get a reply back, the sender must repeat it until the receiver starts closing the loop.
If there is difficulty in confirming reception of a message, the sender may need to consider rephrasing the message.
5.3.2. CLOSED LOOP COMMUNICATIONS [READ-BACK]
Closed-loop communication should be used to confirm that messages from VTS personnel are correctly received and understood.
This can be achieved through the following steps:

5.3.2. CLOSED LOOP COMMUNICATIONS [READ-BACK]

• The VTS operator requesting the recipient to repeat back important information (for example, repeat advice, repeat instruction or repeat back).
5.3.2. CLOSED LOOP COMMUNICATIONS [READ-BACK]
•

5.3.2. CLOSED LOOP COMMUNICATIONS [READ-BACK]
The recipient reading back or acknowledging in a manner to clearly indicate they have understood the message and will take appropriate action.
5.3.2. CLOSED LOOP COMMUNICATIONS [READ-BACK]
•

5.3.2. CLOSED LOOP COMMUNICATIONS [READ-BACK]
The VTS operator listening to the read-back to ascertain that the message has been correctly acknowledged and take immediate action to correct any discrepancies revealed by the read-back.
5.3.2. CLOSED LOOP COMMUNICATIONS [READ-BACK]
