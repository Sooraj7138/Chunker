8.2.5. EXPIRY AND CANCELLATION OF VIRTUAL ATON OBJECTS
Some Virtual AtoN objects like the Application Specific Messages (ASM) may themselves contain a definition of their own lifetime, such as a start date and time with a duration from a few minutes up to 182 days, with the capability to cancel at any time.
8.2.5. EXPIRY AND CANCELLATION OF VIRTUAL ATON OBJECTS
When the lifetime of a Virtual AtoN object is timed out or cancelled, it should be removed from the displays of shipborne navigational systems.
Objects relying on repeated transmissions that have exceeded the nominal reporting rate but have not yet reached the timeout should clearly indicate that the information may not be current.
