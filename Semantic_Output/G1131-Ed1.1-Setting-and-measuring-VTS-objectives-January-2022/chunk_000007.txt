4. SETTING GUIDELINES TO MEASURE OBJECTIVES
Once the objectives for the VTS have been set a process should be implemented to ensure they are being met.
4.1. MEASURING THE OBJECTIVES
To monitor and assess that the objectives set for the VTS are met, measures need to be determined.
This is to identify that the VTS is effectively contributing to alleviate, or at least reducing to an acceptable level and the issues /problems the VTS was introduced to mitigate (e.g., risk of collisions/groundings, navigational hazards, complexity of waterway).
4.1. MEASURING THE OBJECTIVES
Both positive (leading) and negative (lag) performance measures should be considered.
This ensures that operational outcomes are measured in terms of the success of good practice and the preventative measures that need to be implemented.
