ANNEX D FURTHER LEGAL AND SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
VTS providers should also consider the purpose of any re-use of VTS information and how that influences the form and time in which information may be provided.
For example, information to alert or assist search and rescue operations would generally be required freely and urgently.
Other uses, such as compiling data on past shipping trends, could be provided at a later time, perhaps affording sufficient time for a formal written application.
ANNEX D FURTHER LEGAL AND SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
In many cases, the high level legislation under which the VTS operates may determine how data and information may be re-used.
If a VTS provider is part of an agency whose objectives include safety at sea, security and protection of the marine environment, it may be easier to provide information to organizations undertaking similar or complementary work such as marine parks and fisheries management.
Another issue in some countries may be whether the eventual use of the transferred information is consistent with the purpose for which it was originally collected.
Clearly describing and specifying the purpose for which the data is collected in the first place from the outset may solve this issue.
ANNEX D FURTHER LEGAL AND SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
Transfer and sharing of data & information, particularly between government agencies, should be based upon an agreement, memorandum of understanding or similar instrument between the VTS provider and the organization requiring the data.
It is also recommended that VTS providers develop clear protocols and procedures so that data transfer is implemented and maintained consistently and correctly.
ANNEX D FURTHER LEGAL AND SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
The type and format of information supplied by the VTS provider may influence the extent of its distribution.
Aggregated information on shipping movement trends may be more readily and widely distributed than information that identifies individual vessels.
ANNEX D FURTHER LEGAL AND SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
In many countries, specific legal instruments may override other general policies.
Examples of such instruments include search warrants and court orders.
Other factors that may influence the interaction include but are not limited to:

ANNEX D FURTHER LEGAL AND SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

• National laws and policies on the reuse of public data.

• Data storage regulations.

• Legal investigation protection.

ANNEX D FURTHER LEGAL AND SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
Where VTS information may need to be used for evidence purposes, VTS providers should consider data collection and storage protocols that will safeguard the information & data’s security and handling continuity to protect the information & data’s admissibility as evidence in court.
ANNEX D FURTHER LEGAL AND SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
If more than one agency or country contributes to the collection of information supplied to a VTS provider, the question of data ownership and transfer policy may need to be jointly resolved.
All VTS providers should also consider the issue of protocols for any subsequent transfer of information from the recipient organization to third parties.
