A vessel’s departure from or arrival to a berth or anchorage or when entering a lock or confined waterway is a critical moment when a vessel’s movements may have a direct influence on other vessels nearby.
5.1. ROUTINE PROCEDURES
In particular, the departure of a vessel from a berth is a critical moment when situational awareness of bridge staff on the departing vessel may be diverted and impaired by internal or jetty-side issues and when other vessels in the immediate vicinity might be surprised by the unexpected movement of another vessel into the fairway.

• Standard and formal message for approval from the VTS for a vessel to proceed

5.1. ROUTINE PROCEDURES

• Standard and formal message for refusal from the VTS for a vessel to proceed

5.1. ROUTINE PROCEDURES
Permission for a vessel to proceed means that, based on the information available, the VTS assesses that it is safe and gives approval for the vessel to proceed on its intended course of action, subject to the discretion of the master.

IALA Guideline G1089 Provision of VTS Services [15]states that “before navigational support is provided and if time permits, a VTS should make an assessment of capabilities and conduct other relevant checks” whilst recognizing that, when the need is observed to be necessary by the VTS, early intervention is likely to be necessary, which may preclude pre-assessment checks being carried out.
5.1. ROUTINE PROCEDURES
Some considerations for making a pre-assessment prior to the provision of navigational support are provided in annex A.
