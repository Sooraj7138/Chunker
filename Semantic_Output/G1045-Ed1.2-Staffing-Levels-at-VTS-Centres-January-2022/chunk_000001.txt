1. INTRODUCTION
IMO Resolution A.1158(32) Guidelines for Vessel Traffic Services identifies competencies for training and qualifications required by VTS personnel and recognizes IALA as the authority for establishing the appropriate standards.

1. INTRODUCTION
IALA provides guidance in determining how VTS Authorities may recruit, select and train personnel in order to carry out their tasks thereby providing the required VTS standards.

1. INTRODUCTION
In planning and establishing a VTS, the Contracting Government(s) or the competent authority should:


1. INTRODUCTION

• ensure that the VTS provider has the equipment and facilities necessary to effectively accomplish the objectives of the VTS; and


1. INTRODUCTION

• ensure that the VTS provider has sufficient staff, appropriately qualified, suitably trained and capable of performing the tasks required, taking into consideration, the type and level of services to be provided.

1. INTRODUCTION
The purpose of a VTS is to contribute to safety of life at sea, improve the safety and efficiency of navigation and support the protection of the environment within a VTS area by mitigating the development of unsafe situations.
In fulfilling this purpose, VTS personnel are required to interact with other mariners with responsibility for safety.
It is therefore essential that the VTS operational staff demonstrate a high standard of professionalism and that they are trained and qualified according to the current international IALA standards.1


1. INTRODUCTION
VTS personnel should be capable of providing the service in the specified VTS area.
Depending on the characteristics of a VTS Area, such as traffic patterns and densities, a VTS Centre may comprise VTS Operators (VTSOs), VTS Supervisors and a VTS Manager.
It is for the VTS provider to determine the levels of staffing sufficient to meet its obligations and to ensure that trained personnel are available to undertake these commitments.

1. INTRODUCTION
Key to all VTS operations is the VTSO.
Regardless of the size or complexity of the respective VTS area, all VTS Centres are likely to require VTSOs who have been trained and authorized to R0103 (V-103) standards, or similar.
In VTS Centres where more than one VTSO is on watch simultaneously, the VTS provider may determine a requirement to establish the position of VTS Supervisor to assist, oversee and/or co-ordinate the activities of the watchkeeping VTSO's.

1. INTRODUCTION
A VTS provider may elect, as part of its management infrastructure, to establish the post of VTS manager.
