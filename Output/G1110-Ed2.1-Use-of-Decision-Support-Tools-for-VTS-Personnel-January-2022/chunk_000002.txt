REQUIREMENTS OF DECISION SUPPORT TOOLS DSTs may be based upon real-time, near real-time and long-term planning assessment of risks associated with navigational safety and efficiency and the prediction of traffic situations.
The DST should: provide alerts and indicators (audible and / or visible); 
• reduce the workload; 
• enhance efficiency; be accurate and in real time; be configurable with local VTS operational procedures; 
• facilitate the result-oriented decision making by VTS personnel in accordance with the purpose of the VTS; use the available data to predict future situations; 
• comply with IALA Recommendation R0125 The use and presentation of Symbology at a VTS Centre [4]; and 
• have recording capability.
When the risk level exceeds a pre-defined threshold, the VTSO may be advised of the recommended risk mitigation options.
IALA Guideline G1110 Use of Decision Support Tools for VTS Personnel Edition 2.1 urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1110:ed2.1 4) P 6 2.6. TRAINING The VTS provider should ensure that VTS personnel are adequately trained in the use of DSTs.
General training on the general principles of types and common uses of DSTs should be provided in IALA Model Course C0103-1 VTS Operator Training (V103/1) [6].
Specific training on the use and application of DSTs within specific VTS centres should be provided as a component of IALA Model Course C0103-3 VTS On-the-Job Training (V103/3) [7].
Additionally, further training should be provided when new DSTs are introduced, or modifications are made to existing DSTs and covered within C0103-5 Revalidation Process for VTS Qualification and Certification (V103/5) [8].
Emphasis should be given on the inputs and limitations of the DSTs.
IALA Guideline G1110 Use of Decision Support Tools for VTS Personnel Edition 2.1 urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1110:ed2.1 ® P 7 EXAMPLES OF WHEN DECISION SUPPORT TOOLS MAY BE USED The following table provides examples of where DSTs may assist in ensuring the safety and efficiency of navigation, through route and traffic management, monitoring and protection of assets, environmental and fairway monitoring, incident response and anomaly detection.
The table demonstrates the harmonized relationship between the pre-requisites necessary for the alert to work, the type of alert which may be appropriate and the user interface for each use case.
These are further categorized according to whether they are deemed long term planning, near real-time or real-time, which indicates how the system may be used for analysis to identify risks, quantify throughput, and adjust operational procedures as well as real-time incident and situational awareness.
