9. NOTIFICATION
Having elected to deploy Virtual AtoN, competent authorities should arrange for detailed information related to such aids to be made available to all concerned.

9. NOTIFICATION
Competent authorities should use all available means to ensure that mariners have the necessary information concerning the presence and purpose of Virtual aids and notify their national hydrographic offices for inclusion and updates in nautical publications, including charts.

9. NOTIFICATION
As with other aids to navigation, mariners have an obligation to report improperly or not displayed Virtual aids to navigation to the competent authority.

10. RISKS AND LIMITATIONS
Virtual AtoN are now becoming visible on the displays of many ships and, when visible, the symbols may differ from one display to another.
The consequences may be confusion, lack of information for the user and undermining confidence in shipborne navigational displays and new technology.
The implementation date of the revised standard for shipborne navigational displays on the bridge of a ship for radar equipment, ECDIS and INS should be 1 January 2024 and for all other navigational displays on the bridge of a ship 1 July 2025.


10. RISKS AND LIMITATIONS
It is still possible that when an AIS AtoN is reflected in S-57 and S-52, existing ECDIS will only show a question mark (?), symbolizing an unknown object.
The question mark symbol can be interrogated for further detail.

10. RISKS AND LIMITATIONS
The Minimum Keyboard Display (MKD) should display AIS AtoN, including the Virtual flag, but it is known that some MKDs do not meet this requirement.
Table 1 Potential risk mitigation measures
Risk Potential mitigation Mariners should not rely solely on Virtual AtoN but cross-check with other data or information.
Complete dependence of on Virtual AtoN.
Navigation should be by visual and radar reference from fixed aids on shore or other charted landmarks and through the use of navigation systems, whenever possible.
MSI should be maintained as primary notification.
Not all mariners will receive or be able to display Virtual AtoN.
Virtual AtoN supplement MSI.
Encourage integration with navigational displays, where fitted.
Development of e-Navigation and S Mode.
Use of lines and areas (such as ASM) versus points.
Only competent authorities may approve.
Information overload Area specific display.
Development of e-Navigation.
Limited use of Virtual AtoN in any area.
Lack of user awareness or understanding.
