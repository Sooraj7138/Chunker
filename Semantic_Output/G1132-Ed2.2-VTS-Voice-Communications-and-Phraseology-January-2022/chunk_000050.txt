6.3.4. INFORMATION BROADCASTS
When providing Information, the VTS may direct the message to a particular ship.
Alternatively, general information may be to all ships in the area by a routine broadcast message.
This may contain a number of the message elements listed above combining traffic information, weather information and tidal/hydrographic information.
A broadcast is directed to “All Ships” and this call is normally repeated three times before the message itself is transmitted.
The message should start with the message marker INFORMATION.
6.3.4. INFORMATION BROADCASTS
Broadcasts may also be used to transmit emergency information in the event of a major marine, environmental, security incident or on suspension of any VTS services, advising of any special restricted / safety areas and any communication restrictions or changes.
In such circumstances the broadcast message should follow ITU/GMDSS manual procedures.
