VOLUNTARY REPORTING 4.2.2.
There is no mandatory international standard for notification of marine incidents or near-miss situations by a VTS, but there are some regional and national requirements to notify incidents (e.g., EU Directives 2002/59/EC [6] and 2009/18/EC Article 6 [7]) by Flag State, masters of ships involved and coastal State.

ADDRESSING NEAR-MISS REPORTS 4.2.4.

ADDRESSING OF THE CASUALTY/INCIDENT REPORTS 4.2.3.
Near-miss reports should be reported internally within VTS providers and/or competent authorities.
The analysis and reporting of near-miss situations may result in corrective actions on the VTS operational procedures and additional training of VTS personnel.
If certified under ISO 9001 [8], the certified body (i.e., VTS Centre) shall monitor, measure, analyse and improve quality management system of the VTS centre.
ADDRESSING OF THE CASUALTY/INCIDENT REPORTS 4.2.3.
The VTS provider and/or competent authorities should decide whether to report near-miss externally in compliance with established QMS/SMS and/or VTS operational procedures.
4.3. SAFETY CULTURE
Conducting investigations and gathering statistics on marine incidents and near-miss situations is a part of developing the safety culture within a VTS Centre.
The overall performance of a VTS can be facilitated by implementing corrective actions (adapting procedures, organizing training based on these statistics, etc.).
4.3. SAFETY CULTURE
With respect to this, two aspects of safety culture are particularly important: a reporting culture and a just culture.
4.3. SAFETY CULTURE
A reporting culture actively encourages personnel to take the time to report issues, near-misses or anything that might influence the safety of the VTS.
Encouragement can be in the form of incentives, but in order to make

reporting sustainable, organizations need to demonstrate that the report has been appropriately considered and responded to.
4.3. SAFETY CULTURE
An effective reporting system depends, crucially, upon how an organization handles blame and punishment.
This lies at the heart of any safety culture.
A prerequisite for a just culture is that all members of an organization should understand where the line must be drawn between unacceptable behaviour, deserving of disciplinary action, and the remainder, where punishment is neither appropriate nor helpful in furthering the cause of safety.
4.3. SAFETY CULTURE
It is not the objective to determine liability in VTS reports.
The VTS provider should not refrain from fully reporting
