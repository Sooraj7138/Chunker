4.3.3. PROCEDURAL
Information related to: Examples: 
• Deviating from the planned or recommended route towards shallow water, dangerous wrecks or other obstacles not otherwise Warning promulgated.

• Diving operations.

• Ships not under command.

• Instructing a ship to keep clear from area/position.
Note: The VTS provider should give careful consideration to the Instruction authorization of VTS personnel for issuing an Instruction in developing unsafe situations.

5. VTS BEYOND TERRITORIAL SEAS
SOLAS regulation V/12 (Vessel Traffic Services) paragraph 3, specifically states that:


5. VTS BEYOND TERRITORIAL SEAS
“The use of VTS may only be made mandatory in sea areas within the territorial seas of a coastal state.”


5. VTS BEYOND TERRITORIAL SEAS
Recognizing the contribution of VTS to the safety of navigation, improved efficiency of traffic flow and the protection of the marine environment, a VTS may be established beyond territorial seas either:


5. VTS BEYOND TERRITORIAL SEAS
in association with an IMO adopted system; or


5. VTS BEYOND TERRITORIAL SEAS

• on the basis of voluntary participation.
5.1. VTS IN ASSOCIATION WITH AN IMO ADOPTED SYSTEM
IMO Resolution A.1158(32) Guidelines for Vessel Traffic Services states that:

5.1. VTS IN ASSOCIATION WITH AN IMO ADOPTED SYSTEM
“A VTS may be established in association with an IMO adopted ships' routeing system or mandatory ship reporting system in accordance with regulations V/10 and V/11 of the Convention, respectively.”

5.1. VTS IN ASSOCIATION WITH AN IMO ADOPTED SYSTEM
The principles of the provision of VTS to participating ships set out in paragraphs 4.1 – 4.3 still apply, but consideration may need to be given to the legal basis for any powers of regulation and enforcement.
5.2. VTS ON THE BASIS OF VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION
IMO Resolution A.1158(32) Guidelines for Vessel Traffic Services states that:

5.2. VTS ON THE BASIS OF VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION
“A VTS may also be established beyond the territorial seas of a coastal State to provide information and advice on the basis of voluntary participation.”

5.2. VTS ON THE BASIS OF VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION
When a VTS is established beyond the territorial seas of a coastal State solely on the basis of voluntary participation, it is unlikely that it will have any powers of regulation or enforcement.
5.2. VTS ON THE BASIS OF VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION
While the principles of the provision of VTS set out in paragraphs 4.1 – 4.3 above still apply, a VTS established on the basis of voluntary participation is unlikely to be empowered to regulate or issue instructions.
5.2. VTS ON THE BASIS OF VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION
VTS personnel should take into account that where a VTS is established on the basis of voluntary participation, not all ships present in the VTS Area may be participating and may not even be monitoring the designated communications channel(s).
