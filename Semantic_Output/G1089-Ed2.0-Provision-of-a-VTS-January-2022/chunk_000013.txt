4.2.1. EXAMPLES OF THE MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT OF SHIP TRAFFIC

4.2. MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT OF SHIP TRAFFIC
Examples of when the monitoring and management of ship traffic might be required include those shown in Table 2:

4.2. MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT OF SHIP TRAFFIC
Table 2 Examples of situations that may require monitoring and management of ship traffic

4.2. MONITORING AND MANAGEMENT OF SHIP TRAFFIC
Information related to: Examples: 
• On or prior to entering a VTS area.

• Departing from a berth or an anchorage within a VTS area.
Traffic clearance 
• Entering into a fairway within a VTS area.

• Prior to commencing a manoeuvre that may be detrimental to safe navigation.

• Organizing the movements to/from an anchorage position/area.
Anchorage 
• Assigning an anchorage position.

• Assisting ships into anchorage position.

• Ensuring adherence to speed limits.

• Ensuring adherence to rules regarding traffic routeing measures.
Enforcement 
• Ensuring adherence to pilotage requirements.

• Ensuring adherence to traffic regulations and local by-laws.

Information related to: Examples: 
• Requiring a passage plan before entering a VTS area.

• Planning lock and bridge passages.

• Reporting position at determined reporting point/line/pilot station.

• Dredging or compass swing in confined waterway.

• Organizing other traffic when a ship has passed point of no return.
waterway management (sea, channels, and fairway) 
• Organizing the traffic concerning ship dimensions in comparison to fairway restrictions and under keel clearance.

• Establishing and organizing ship safety zones in case of particular operations.

• Establishing and organizing exclusion zones.

• Instructing ships to keep clear from special areas or positions.

• Organizing the traffic as regards to meteorological, hydrographical, or other restrictions such as visibility, wind speed, current and sea state.
4.3. RESPONDING TO DEVELOPING UNSAFE SITUATIONS
Responding to developing unsafe situations involves support to the navigational safety of the ship through the provision of essential navigational information to assist on board navigational decision-making.
It may also involve the provision of navigational advice and/or instruction.
4.3. RESPONDING TO DEVELOPING UNSAFE SITUATIONS
Developing unsafe situations may include:

4.3. RESPONDING TO DEVELOPING UNSAFE SITUATIONS

• A ship unsure of its route or position

4.3. RESPONDING TO DEVELOPING UNSAFE SITUATIONS

• A ship deviating from the route

4.3. RESPONDING TO DEVELOPING UNSAFE SITUATIONS
A ship requiring guidance to an anchoring position

4.3. RESPONDING TO DEVELOPING UNSAFE SITUATIONS
A ship that has defects or deficiencies, such as navigation or manoeuvring equipment failure

4.3. RESPONDING TO DEVELOPING UNSAFE SITUATIONS

• Meteorological conditions (e.g., low visibility, strong winds)

4.3. RESPONDING TO DEVELOPING UNSAFE SITUATIONS

• A ship at risk of grounding or collision

4.3. RESPONDING TO DEVELOPING UNSAFE SITUATIONS
Emergency response or support to emergency services

4.3. RESPONDING TO DEVELOPING UNSAFE SITUATIONS
A ship deviating from the passage plan

4.3. RESPONDING TO DEVELOPING UNSAFE SITUATIONS
Assistance to a ship to support the unexpected incapacity of a key member of the bridge team

4.3. RESPONDING TO DEVELOPING UNSAFE SITUATIONS
Key considerations in responding to developing unsafe situations include:

4.3. RESPONDING TO DEVELOPING UNSAFE SITUATIONS

• Navigational support should not be considered to be an alternative to pilotage.
4.3. RESPONDING TO DEVELOPING UNSAFE SITUATIONS
•

4.3. RESPONDING TO DEVELOPING UNSAFE SITUATIONS
If VTS interaction is considered necessary or navigational support requested, the general principle should be that it is used to get the ship to a place of safety to enable the ship to recover from the situation for which navigational support was initially required.
This could include regaining situational awareness, effecting repairs or embarking a pilot to continue its passage.
4.3. RESPONDING TO DEVELOPING UNSAFE SITUATIONS

• Navigational support depends on many factors including:

4.3. RESPONDING TO DEVELOPING UNSAFE SITUATIONS
Status of the waterway, including other ships in the area and weather conditions

4.3. RESPONDING TO DEVELOPING UNSAFE SITUATIONS

• Equipment capabilities and limitations

4.3. RESPONDING TO DEVELOPING UNSAFE SITUATIONS
Clarity of communications between VTS and ship

4.3. RESPONDING TO DEVELOPING UNSAFE SITUATIONS

• Navigational support may be carried out on the main working channel or an alternative to avoid overloading the working frequency.

•

4.3. RESPONDING TO DEVELOPING UNSAFE SITUATIONS
Before navigational support is provided and if time permits, a VTS should make an assessment of capabilities and conduct other relevant checks.
4.3. RESPONDING TO DEVELOPING UNSAFE SITUATIONS

• The commencement and conclusion of direct navigational support should be formalized if time permits.
4.3. RESPONDING TO DEVELOPING UNSAFE SITUATIONS
The provision of navigational support is likely to be required in three generic circumstances:

4.3. RESPONDING TO DEVELOPING UNSAFE SITUATIONS

• When observed

4.3. RESPONDING TO DEVELOPING UNSAFE SITUATIONS

• On request

4.3. RESPONDING TO DEVELOPING UNSAFE SITUATIONS

• Procedural
