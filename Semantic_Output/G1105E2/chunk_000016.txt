5.1.2. GRAPHS
In some situations, a time-series graph may be preferred instead of a table format.
In particular, it is a useful way to show both predicted and real-time information (e.g., water levels); as well as a useful means to indicate trends (e.g., rising or falling water levels).
5.1.2. GRAPHS
5.1.3. POINT, LINE OR POLYGON

5.1.2. GRAPHS
This type of information is often displayed as an overlay on chart or map-related background.
An Area Notice that is transmitted via AIS Application Specific Message is one example.
5.1.4. SYMBOL
Similar to the guidance stated in IMO SN.1/Circ.290, the following guiding principles apply to the display of symbols or icons:

5.1.4. SYMBOL
Use consistent symbology across all displays

5.1.4. SYMBOL
Uniqueness – only one possible meaning

5.1.4. SYMBOL
Non-ambiguous – ability to determine differences (i.e., distinct)

5.1.4. SYMBOL
Intuitively obvious – an easily recognized symbol, icon, or pattern

5.1.4. SYMBOL
Have a basic symbol for different categories.
Further attributes should be enhancements (not changes) to the basic symbol.

5.1.5. GEO-SPATIAL
Many types of geo-spatial information are best provided in the form of a map or chart.
The electronic chart display of an ENC in ECDIS is one example.
Another example would be a radar display with chart facilities.
5.1.6. IMAGERY
This is a broad category that includes various types of images.
A still photograph of a fixed or floating AtoN is one example.
Other examples include radar or satellite imagery of sea ice weather conditions.
A video recording/replay of a past or simulated voyage is a type of dynamic imagery.
There is also increasing interest in the use of 3-D imagery.
