• Guideline G1160 Competencies for planning and implementing VTS

4.2.1. IALA GUIDANCE
In waterways where a national authority is of the opinion that the navigational complexity, volume of traffic or the degree of risk does not justify the establishment of a VTS, a Local Port Service (LPS) may be implemented.
In such circumstances, IALA provides guidance in Guideline G1142, The Provision of Local Port Services other than VTS.
4.2.1. IALA GUIDANCE
Further guidance is also provided in Guideline G1083 Standard Nomenclature to Identify and Refer to a VTS.
4.2.2. INLAND WATERS CONSIDERATIONS
IMO Resolution A.1158(32) states the responsibilities of a VTS provider and those of participating ships which may also be relevant to an inland VTS.
In particular, an inland VTS should be provided with appropriate equipment, systems and facilities for the delivery of the inland VTS and should be adequately staffed with inland VTS personnel who are appropriately trained and qualified.
This is further expanded in IALA guidance.
4.2.2. INLAND WATERS CONSIDERATIONS
If it is assessed that the navigational complexity, volume of traffic or the degree of risk does not justify the establishment of an inland VTS but that some form of co-ordination of local services is required, then note should be taken of the provisions of Guideline G1142 for the establishment of a local port service or equivalent noting the provisions of Guideline G1083 that any service that is not authorized as a VTS should not use the term “VTS” in its name identifier.
