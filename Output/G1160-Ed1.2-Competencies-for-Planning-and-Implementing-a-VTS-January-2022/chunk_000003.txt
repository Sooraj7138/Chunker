for Standardization (ISO).
IALA Guideline G1150 highlights the five project management phases and the key areas for consideration as they relate to VTS: 
1. Initiating - This marks the beginning of the project.
The goal of this phase is to define the proposed implementation of a VTS at a broad level and its feasibility to address the issues and problems associated with the volume of traffic and degree of risk in the waterway.

2. Planning - During this phase, the scope and goals of the project are defined and a project management plan is developed.
It involves identifying the cost, quality, available resources and a realistic timetable.
Implementing - This is the phase where deliverables are developed and completed.

4. Controlling - This phase is invariable carried out simultaneously with Phase 3 (Implementing), thereby ensuring that project objectives and deliverables are met.
This phase is about measuring project progression and performance and ensuring that everything happening aligns with the project management plan.

5. Closing - The closing processes are used to formally establish that the project phase or project is finished.
Authorities should ensure that those responsible for the planning and implementing a VTS are competent in project management and have the necessary knowledge, skills and capability to effectively and efficiently establish, plan and implement the VTS to recognized standards.
5.1. WHAT KNOWLEDGE AND COMPETENCIES ARE REQUIRED WHEN PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTING A VTS?
The following table shows the knowledge and competencies required when planning and implementing a VTS: Table 3 Competencies for planning and implementing a VTS Competencies for Planning and Implementing a VTS Phase Element The principles and practices associated with: 
• Business Case - This document identifies the need for a VTS, providing justification for implementing a VTS, including evaluation of the benefits, cost and risk of alternative options and provides a rationale for the preferred solution.

• Feasibility Study – This document establishes whether a VTS is a viable solution to address the issue or problem.

• Risk Assessment - To support the feasibility study a process of comprehensive information gathering, and analysis is inevitably involved to enable relevant issues and problems in the maritime area to be identified, assessed, defined, and analysed.

1. Initiating IALA recommends the use of the IALA risk management toolbox for assessing the risks in waterways when initiating and planning a VTS.
Further information is available from: 
• Recommendation R1002 Risk Management for Marine Aids to Navigation [14].

• Guideline G1123 The Use of IALA Waterway Risk Assessment Programme (IWRAP MKII)[15] .

• Guideline G1124 The Use of Ports and Waterways Safety Assessment (PAWSA) MKII Tool [16] .

• Guideline G1138 The Use of the Simplified IALA Risk Assessment Method (SIRA) [17] .

The principles and practices associated with preparing project management documentation, including: IALA Guideline G1160 Competencies for Planning and Implementing a VTS Edition 1.2 urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1160:ed1.2 3 P 9 Competencies for Planning and Implementing a VTS Phase Element 
• Project plan – identifies the project timeline, including the phases of the project, the tasks to be performed, and possible constraints (for example, financial budgets, resourcing etc).

• Functional requirements – defining the operational behaviours and functions the VTS is to accomplish to achieve its objectives.

• Risk plan – identifies anticipated risks and issues that may cause potential quality roadblocks and to mitigate those risks.

• Communications plan – to establish the appropriate level of communication engagement with stakeholders.

• Procurement plan – the purchasing requirements to meet the needs of the proposed VTS.

• Acceptance plan – to identify the tasks that need to be completed to implement a VTS and the criteria that must be met before the VTS is declared operational.
Skills to coordinate and direct project resources to: 
3. Implementing 
• meet the objectives and deliverables described in the project plan; and 
• manage the financial and resourcing aspects of the project.
Monitoring and controlling skills to keep the project on track by ensuring that the project 
4. Controlling remains within scope, on time and on budget so that the project proceeds with minimal risk.
Skills to close out the implementation, including signing off that the final deliverables of implementing the VTS have been met.

5. Closing Skills to authorize a VTS under national law in accordance with relevant international conventions, IMO instruments and IALA standards.
