Manufacturers may have subsequently edited their products, however.

Figure 3 The symbology of Virtual AIS AtoN

8.2.2. LIMITATIONS
A distinction is made between Physical and Virtual AtoN.
These navigation-related symbols are not chart symbols.
8.2.2. LIMITATIONS
In IEC 62288 (Navigation Displays) [31], which came into force in 2012, the thin dashed line diamond with crossed lines centred at the reported position of the AtoN is specified for AIS AtoN.
This symbol will be implemented as an overlay on navigational equipment (ECDIS, radar etc.) compliant with these specifications.
Generally, the symbols indicate the type of AtoN, and the attached text information indicates that the Virtual flag is active.
The MMSI numbering scheme is another way to recognize that a Virtual AIS AtoN is being broadcast, with the number 6 being displayed right after the MID: 99MID6XXX.
8.2.2. LIMITATIONS
New symbology for AIS AtoN has been issued where the type of AtoN, identified by a topmark (purpose), has been added to the basic diamond shape.
The latest IEC 62288 [31] provides further details.
