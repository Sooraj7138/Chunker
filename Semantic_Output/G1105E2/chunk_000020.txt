6.3.
Formerly called AIS Binary Messages, AIS Application-Specific Messages (ASMs) are transmitted and received by shipborne mobile AIS devices and AIS base stations.
Over 19 AIS message types are described capable of conveying a wide range of hydrographic, meteorological, VTS, area notice, and route information.
The display, generation and transmission of the information transmitted by AIS Application-Specific Messages requires external hardware and dedicated software in addition to the AIS equipment (e.g., ECDIS, ECS or VTS display).
