5.4. VOICE COMMUNICATION IN VTS
To ensure the communication efficiency, deck officers should make use of SMCP, including the use of message markers, and IALA Guideline G1132 VHF Voice Communication.
Several tools are provided in the Guideline to improve the effectiveness of communication.
5.4. VOICE COMMUNICATION IN VTS
Communication should:

5.4. VOICE COMMUNICATION IN VTS

• Clearly indicate the identity of the ship and the VTS centre.
5.4. VOICE COMMUNICATION IN VTS

• Use the assigned frequencies/channels of the VTS.
5.4. VOICE COMMUNICATION IN VTS

• Use the correct reporting procedures of the VTS.
5.4. VOICE COMMUNICATION IN VTS

• Take into account the limitations within radio telecommunication, both when receiving and transmitting communication with a VTS.

6. TRAINING ACTIVITIES
VTS should be included in the mandatory national training programmes for deck officers developed in accordance with the provisions of the STCW Code and be reflected in examination and assessment.
VTS should also be included in other types of training such as bridge resource management, voyage planning, and voice communication.
6.1. THEORY TRAINING
Theory training on VTS should include the following:

6.1. THEORY TRAINING
Introduction of VTS, including functions, responsibilities, and procedures of VTS.
6.1. THEORY TRAINING

• Requirements for transiting through the VTS area.
6.1. THEORY TRAINING

• Benefits of VTS for the bridge team.
6.1. THEORY TRAINING

• Communication methods and standard phraseology between the bridge team and VTS.
6.1. THEORY TRAINING

• Where to find information on VTS.
6.2. PRACTICAL TRAINING
Ships navigating in an area where VTS is provided should make use of these services.
The introduction of VTS in practical training is helpful for deck officers to be familiar with the operation of ships in the VTS area.
Examples of elements for training are provided in table 1.

VTS area decision making − Maintain communication with VTS

6.3.1. VHF
Effective VTS VHF communication directly contributes to navigational safety and efficiency.
VHF communication training improves coordination and understanding between ships and the VTS centre.
This training may also be carried out as simulation.
6.3.2. ECDIS
The use of ECDIS assists in the identification of VTS coverage, and location of the VTS reporting line/point.
Training on ECDIS should include reference to the use of ECDIS in a VTS area.
Examples of elements for training are provided in table 2.

6.3.2. ECDIS
Training activity Evaluation elements Voyage or passage plan through the VTS area − Clarify coverage of VTS and location of VTS reporting points − Voyage or passage planning should include information on the VTS area Monitoring the movement of the ship in the VTS area − Take note of the VTS area and VTS reporting lines/points
