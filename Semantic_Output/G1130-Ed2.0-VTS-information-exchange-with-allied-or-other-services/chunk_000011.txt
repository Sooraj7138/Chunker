3.4.1. AVAILABILITY OF EQUIPMENT AND SERVICES

3.4. AVAILABILITY AND DATA INTEGRITY
Careful consideration should be given to the required availability as part of the agreement between VTS and allied or other services.
A trade-off should be made between availability and cost.
High levels of availability require more complex system architectures and correspondingly higher costs.
3.4. AVAILABILITY AND DATA INTEGRITY
A simple means of improving availability is by having spare parts readily available (which reduces the repair time).
More complex solutions use redundant hardware and/or services.

3.4.2. AVAILABILITY OF DATA

3.4. AVAILABILITY AND DATA INTEGRITY
Consideration should be given to proper backup of data.
This means that data can be restored in case it gets

3.4. AVAILABILITY AND DATA INTEGRITY
corrupted or deleted:

3.4. AVAILABILITY AND DATA INTEGRITY

• Backup frequency (incremental/full)

3.4. AVAILABILITY AND DATA INTEGRITY

• Backup media (disk/tape/cloud/paper punch)

3.4. AVAILABILITY AND DATA INTEGRITY

• Retention of backup copies

3.4. AVAILABILITY AND DATA INTEGRITY
Time needed to restore data from backup

3.4. AVAILABILITY AND DATA INTEGRITY
Safekeeping of backup copies (protection, geographic diversity)

3.4.3. DATA INTEGRITY
Data integrity is a key concern for both users and providers of data.
This means that, in general,

3.4.3. DATA INTEGRITY
data should be traceable to its origin;

3.4.3. DATA INTEGRITY
data corruption/alteration should be detectable;

3.4.3. DATA INTEGRITY
data should be properly time-stamped and should, preferably, have a quality attribute; and

3.4.3. DATA INTEGRITY

• data providers should have procedures in place to ensure the proper functioning of the data capture/generation process.
3.4.3. DATA INTEGRITY
Data that is not available or is detected as invalid should be represented as such.
