3. PRINCIPLES OF MANAGEMENT PROCESSES
VTS providers may consider using the PLAN -> DO -> CHECK -> ACT (PDCA) cycle when applying management processes.
This four-step model assists with managing business processes and ensures a continuous process of improvement.
It helps to identify goals and plan actions, deploy the means to achieve them, evaluate the results, and finally check what adjustments might be necessary.
The model is designed to operate at all levels and can be applied to all processes.

The PDCA cycle includes:

Planning: investigating needs, identifying goals and determining courses of action;

4. MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES
The VTS provider should ensure management activities are in place to ensure the provision of VTS is consistent with their responsibilities as defined in IMO Resolution A.1158(32) and any additional requirements identified by their competent authority.
Activities that may be associated with the management of a VTS are described below.
In planning and organizing the management framework, these activities could be allocated to one person or may involve multiple people depending on the structure of the organization.
The VTS provider should ensure the management structure is optimized for achieving the objectives of the VTS.
