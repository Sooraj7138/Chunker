C.12. RISK ASSESSMENT AND INCIDENT CLASSIFICATION
Correct classification of an incident is vital at the earliest possible stage, to ensure that an appropriate level of response and interaction with relevant allied services are initiated.
The numerous factors affecting the severity, complexity and duration of an incident must be thoroughly assessed.
Incidents are to be classified only by authorized and qualified persons.
