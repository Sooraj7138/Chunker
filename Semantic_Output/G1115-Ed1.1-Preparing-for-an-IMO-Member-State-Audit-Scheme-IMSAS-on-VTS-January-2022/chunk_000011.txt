5. PREPARING FOR AN IMSAS AUDIT – VESSEL TRAFFIC SERVICES
IMSAS covers a broad range of maritime safety and prevention of pollution issues which are reflected in SOLAS, MARPOL, TONNAGE, Load Line, STCW and COLREGs.
A VTS is an important element of the audit scheme, which should be carefully prepared.
To assist with planning and preparation for an audit, annexes A and B provide guidance and check lists for audit preparations.
Furthermore, the following issues should be considered:

Wherever possible, clarification of any special organizational arrangements should be fully detailed.

• A designated single point of contact is required for the Member State.
