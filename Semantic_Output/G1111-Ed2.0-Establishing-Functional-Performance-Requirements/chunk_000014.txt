EQUIPMENT SHELTERS 3.3.2.
A shelter can provide a protective environment with characteristics that depend on the location and design of the shelter.
In situations where contained equipment is reliant on the environment created by the shelter, the shelter facilities (e.g., cooling or heating) may become critical to the achieved availability of the equipment.
