6.3.
This Guideline addresses actions that are intended to aid harmonization, including the establishment and use of the IALA AIS ASM collection.
The intended use of the collection is to promote harmonization through:

6.3.
a catalogue of messages for entities to consider for use to meet identified requirements; and

6.3.
providing manufacturers with a reference for messages they may implement in their equipment.
6.3.
While portrayal is outside the scope of this guideline, IMO has also issued SN.1/Circ.
