IALA Guideline G1118 Marine Casualty / Incident Reporting and Recording, Including Near-miss Situations as it Relates to a VTS Edition 1.1 urn:mrn:iala:pub:g1017:ed1.1 P 9 3 Casualty reports together with relevant recorded VTS information can be used by Marine Safety Investigation Authority for further investigation (according to MSC.255(84) Casualty Investigation Code).
Operational/law enforcement authorities may be interested in receiving information regarding marine incidents/casualties in their area of responsibility as soon as possible.
Incident reports can serve as a source of experience for all stakeholders (VTS personnel, pilots, shipping companies, etc.) and contribute to safety culture.
VTS providers and stakeholders can take into consideration the positive learning from casualty, incident and near- miss reports.
These reports provide opportunities to how the VTS may further improve the safety and efficiency of navigation, safety of life at sea and the protection of the marine environment and/or the adjacent shore area, worksites and offshore installations from possible adverse effects.
